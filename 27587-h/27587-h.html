        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The invasion of Greece by Xerxes, with its battles of Thermopylæ, Salamis, and Platæa,
          forms one of the most dramatic events in history. Had Athens and Sparta succumbed to this
          attack of Oriental superstition and despotism, the Parthenon, the Attic Theatre, the
          Dialogues of Plato, would have been almost as impossible as if Phidias, Sophocles, and the
          philosophers had never lived. Because this contest and its heroes—Leonidas and
          Themistocles—cast their abiding shadows across our world of to-day, I have attempted this
          piece of historical fiction. </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Many of the scenes were conceived on the fields of action themselves during a recent
          visit to Greece, and I have tried to give some glimpse of the natural beauty of <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            Land of the Hellene,”</span>—a beauty that will remain when Themistocles and his peers fade
          away still further into the backgrounds of history. </p>

            chariot race had just ended in the adjoining hippodrome; and the idle crowd, intent on a
            new excitement, came surging up like waves. In such a whirlpool of tossing arms and

            bowed as his ready stylus made the entry. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Simonides of Ceos, Simonides the most noted poet in Hellas!”</span> cried the first of

            <span class="tei tei-q">“With all the joy in the world.”</span> The little poet coloured with delight at the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Aided again by his two protectors, Simonides was soon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>clear of the whirlpool. Under one of the graceful pines, which girded the long
            stadium, he recovered breath and looked at leisure upon his new acquaintances. Both were
            striking men, but in sharp contrast: the taller and darker showed an aquiline visage
            betraying a strain of non-Grecian blood. His black eyes and large mouth were very merry.
            He wore his green chiton with a rakishness that proved him anything but a dandy. His
            companion, addressed as Democrates, slighter, blonder, showed Simonides a handsome and
            truly Greek profile, set off by a neatly trimmed reddish beard. His purple-edged cloak
            fell in statuesque folds of the latest mode, his beryl signet-ring, scarlet fillet, and
            jewelled <a name="corr006" id="corr006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">girdle</span> bespoke wealth and taste. His face, too, might
            have seemed frank and affable, had not Simonides suddenly recalled an old proverb about
            mistrusting a man with eyes too close together. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> said the little poet, quite as ready to pay compliments as to take them,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“let me thank my noble deliverers, for I am sure two such valorous young men as you
              must come of the best blood of Attica.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Then I clasp the hand of Cimon, the son of the saviour of Hellas.”</span> The little

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your compliments exceed all truth,”</span> exclaimed the second Athenian, not at all
            angered by the praise. But Simonides, whose tongue was brisk, ran on with a torrent of
            flattery and of polite insinuation, until Cimon halted him, with a query. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet why, dear Cean, since, as you say, you only arrived this afternoon at the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Why? Because I, like all Greece outside of Sparta, seem to be turning Glaucon-mad.
              All the way from Thessaly—in Bœotia, in Attica, in Megara—men talked of him, his
              beauty, his prowess, his quarrel with his father, his marriage with Hermione, the
              divinest maiden in Athens, and how he has gone to the games to win both the crown and
              crusty Conon’s forgiveness. I tell you, every mule-driver along the way seemed to have
              staked his obol on him. They praise him as <span class="tei tei-q">‘fair as Delian Apollo,’</span>
              <span class="tei tei-q">‘graceful as young Hermes,’</span> and—here I wonder most,—<span class="tei tei-q">‘modest as an unwedded

              Athenians; do you know him?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Know him?”</span> Cimon laughed heartily; <span class="tei tei-q">“have we not left him at the wrestling
              ground? Was not Democrates his schoolfellow once, his second self to-day? And touching
              his beauty, his valour, his modesty,”</span> the young man’s eyes shone with loyal
            enthusiasm, <span class="tei tei-q">“do not say <span class="tei tei-q">‘over-praised’</span> till you have seen him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Simonides swelled with delight. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The <span class="tei tei-q">“Precinct of Poseidon,”</span> the great walled enclosure where were the temples,
            porticos, and the stadium of the Isthmus, was quickly behind them. They walked eastward
            along the <a name="corr008" id="corr008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">sea-shore</span>. The scene about was 
            brisk enough, had they heeded. A dozen chariots
            passed. Under every tall pine along the way stood merchants’ booths, each with a goodly
            crowd. Now a herd of brown goats came, the offering of a pious Phocian; now a band of
            Aphrodite’s priestesses from Corinth whirled by in no overdecorous dance, to a deafening
            noise of citharas and castanets. A soft breeze was sending the brown-sailed fisher boats
            across the heaving bay. Straight before the three spread the white stuccoed houses of
            Cenchræa, the eastern haven of Corinth; far ahead in smooth semicircle rose the green
            crests of the Argive mountains, while to their right upreared the steep lonely pyramid
            of brown rock, Acro-Corinthus, the commanding citadel of the thriving city. But above,
            beyond these, fairer than them all, spread the clear, sun-shot azure of Hellas, the like
            whereof is not over any other land, save as that land is girt by the crisp foam of the
            blue Ægean Sea. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So much for the picture, but Simonides, having seen it often, saw it not at all, but
            plied the others with questions. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The pair were markedly contrasted. The younger was in his early prime, strong, well
            developed, and daintily dressed. His gestures were quick and eloquent. His brown beard
            and hair were trimmed short to reveal a clear olive face—hardly regular, but expressive
            and tinged with an extreme subtilty. When he laughed, in a strange, silent way, it was
            to reveal fine teeth, while his musical tongue ran on, never waiting for answer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His comrade, however, answered little. He barely rose to the other’s shoulder, but he
            had the chest and sinews of an ox. Graces there were none. His face was a scarred
            ravine, half covered by scanty stubble. The forehead was low. The eyes, gray and wise,
            twinkled from tufted eyebrows. The long gray hair was tied about his forehead in a braid
            and held by a golden circlet. The <span class="tei tei-q">“chlamys”</span> around his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hips was purple but dirty. To his companion’s glib Attic he returned only
            Doric monosyllables. </p>

            Leonidas also. The cry <span class="tei tei-q">“A fight!”</span> was producing its inevitable result. Scores of
            men, and those not the most aristocratic, were running pell-mell whither so many had
            thronged already. In the confusion scant reverence was paid the king of Sparta and the
            first statesman of Athens, who were thrust unceremoniously aside and were barely
            witnesses of what followed. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The outcry was begun, after-report had it, by a Sicyonian bronze-dealer finding a
            small but valuable lamp missing from the table whereon he showed his wares. Among the
            dozen odd persons pressing about the booth his eye singled out a slight, handsome boy in
            Oriental dress; and since Syrian serving-lads were proverbially light-fingered, the
            Sicyonian jumped quickly at his conclusion. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seize the Barbarian thief!”</span> had been his shout as he leaped and snatched the
            alleged culprit’s mantle. The boy escaped easily by the frailness of his dress, which
            tore in the merchant’s hands; but a score of bystanders seized the fugitive and dragged
            him back to the Sicyonian, whose order to <span class="tei tei-q">“search!”</span> would have been promptly
            obeyed; but at this instant he stumbled over the missing lamp on the ground before the
            table, whence probably it had fallen. The bronze-dealer was now mollified, and would
            willingly have released the lad, but a Spartan bystander was more zealous. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Here’s a Barbarian thief and spy!”</span> he began bellowing; <span class="tei tei-q">“he dropped the lamp when
              he was detected! Have him to the temple and to the wardens of the games!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The magic word <span class="tei tei-q">“spy”</span> let loose the tongues and passions of every man within
            hearing. The unfortunate lad was seized again and jostled rudely, while questions
            rattled over him like hailstones. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Whose slave are you? Why here? Where’s your master? Where did you get that outlandish

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If the prisoner had understood Greek,—which was doubtful,—he could scarce have
            comprehended this babel. He struggled vainly; tears started to his eyes. Then he
            committed a blunder. Not attempting a protest, he thrust <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a small hand into his crimson belt and drew forth a handful of gold as bribe for

            <span class="tei tei-q">“A slave with ten darics!”</span> bawled the officious Spartan, never relaxing his grip.
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Hark you, friends, it’s plain as day. Dexippus of Corinth has a Syrian lad like
              this. The young scoundrel’s robbed his master and is running away.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“That’s it! A runaway! To the temple with him!”</span> chimed a dozen. The prisoner’s
            outcries were drowned. He would have been swept off in ungentle custody had not a strong
            hand intervened in his favor. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A moment, good citizens,”</span> called a voice in clear Attic. <span class="tei tei-q">“Release this lad. I
              know Dexippus’s slave; he’s no such fellow.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The others, low-browed Spartans mostly, turned, ill-pleased at the interruption of an
            Athenian, but shrank a step as a name went among them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Castor and Pollux—it’s Glaucon the Beautiful!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With two thrusts of impetuous elbows, the young man was at the assailed lad’s side.
            The newcomer was indeed a sight for gods. Beauty and power seemed wholly met in a figure
            of perfect symmetry and strength. A face of fine regularity, a chiselled profile, smooth
            cheeks, deep blue eyes, a crown of closely cropped auburn hair, a chin neither weak nor
            stern, a skin burnt brown by the sun of the wrestling schools—these were parts of the
            picture, and the whole was how much fairer than any part! Aroused now, he stood with
            head cast back and a scarlet cloak shaking gracefully from his shoulders. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Unhand the lad!”</span> he repeated. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For a moment, compelled by his beauty, the Spartans yielded. The Oriental pressed
            against his protector; but the affair was not to end so easily. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hark you, Sir Athenian,”</span> rejoined the Spartan leader, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“don’t presume on your good looks. Our Lycon will mar them all

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He plucked at the boy’s girdle; but the athlete extended one slim hand, seized the
            Spartan’s arm, and with lightning dexterity laid the busybody flat on Mother Earth. He
            staggered upward, raging and calling on his fellows. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparta insulted by Athens! Vengeance, men of Lacedæmon! Fists! Fists!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fate of the Oriental was forgotten in the storm of patriotic fury that followed.
            Fortunately no one had a weapon. Half a dozen burly Laconians precipitated themselves
            without concert or order upon the athlete. He was hidden a moment in the rush of
            flapping gowns and tossing arms. Then like a rock out of the angry sea shone his golden
            head, as he shook off the attack. Two men were on their backs, howling. The others stood
            at respectful distance, cursing and meditating another rush. An Athenian pottery
            merchant from a neighbouring booth began trumpeting through his hands. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Men of Athens, this way!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His numerous countrymen came scampering from far and wide. Men snatched up stones and
            commenced snapping off pine boughs for clubs. The athlete, centre of all this din, stood
            smiling, with his glorious head held high, his eyes alight with the mere joy of battle.
            He held out his arms. Both pose and face spoke as clearly as words,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Prove me!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparta is insulted. Away with the braggart!”</span> the Laconians were clamouring. The
            Athenians answered in kind. Already a dark sailor was drawing a dirk. Everything
            promised broken heads, and perhaps blood, when Leonidas <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and his friend,—by laying about them with their staves,—won their way to the front.
            The king dashed his staff upon the shoulder of a strapping Laconian who was just hurling
            himself on Glaucon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fools! Hold!”</span> roared Leonidas, and the moment the throng saw what newcomers they
            faced, Athenian and Spartan let their arms drop and stood sheepish and silent.
            Themistocles instantly stepped forward and held up his hand. His voice, trumpet-clear,
            rang out among the pines. In three sentences he dissolved the tumult. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fellow-Hellenes, do not let Dame Discord make sport of you. I saw all that befell. It
              is only an unlucky misunderstanding. You are quite satisfied, I am sure, Master
              Bronze-Dealer?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Sicyonian, who saw in a riot the ruin of his evening’s trade, nodded gladly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He says there was no thieving, and he is entirely satisfied. He thanks you for your
              friendly zeal. The Oriental was not Dexippus’s slave, and Xerxes does not need such
              boys for spies. I am certain Glaucon would not insult Sparta. So let us part without
              bad blood, and await the judgment of the god in the contest to-morrow.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Not a voice answered him. The crash of music from the sacrificial embassy of Syracuse
            diverted everybody’s attention; most of the company streamed away to follow the
            flower-decked chariots and cattle back to the temple. Themistocles and Leonidas were
            left almost alone to approach the athlete. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are ever Glaucon the Fortunate,”</span> laughed Themistocles; <span class="tei tei-q">“had we not chanced
              this way, what would not have befallen?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, it was delightful,”</span> rejoined the athlete, his eyes still kindled; <span class="tei tei-q">“the
              shock, the striving, the putting one’s own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strength
              and will against many and feeling <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am the stronger.’</span> ”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Delightful, no doubt”</span> replied the statesman, <span class="tei tei-q">“though Zeus spare me fighting one
              against ten! But what god possessed you to meddle in this brawl, and imperil all
              chances for to-morrow?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I was returning from practice at the palæstra. I saw the lad beset and knew he was
              not Dexippus’s slave. I ran to help him. I thought no more about it.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And risked everything for a sly-eyed Oriental. Where is the rascal?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the lad—author of the commotion—had disappeared completely. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold his fair gratitude to his rescuer,”</span> cried Themistocles, sourly, and then he
            turned to Leonidas. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, very noble king of Sparta, you were asking to see Glaucon
              and judge his chances in the pentathlon. Your Laconians have just proved him; are you
              satisfied?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the king, without a word of greeting, ran his eyes over the athlete from head to
            heel, then blurted out his verdict: </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Too pretty.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon blushed like a maid. Themistocles threw up his hands in deprecation. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“But were not Achilles and many another hero beautiful as brave? Does not Homer call
              them so many times <span class="tei tei-q">‘godlike’</span>?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Poetry doesn’t win the pentathlon,”</span> retorted the king; then suddenly he seized the
            athlete’s right arm near the shoulder. The muscles cracked. Glaucon did not wince. The
            king dropped the arm with a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euge!</span></span>”</span> then extended his own
            hand, the fingers half closed, and ordered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Open.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> One long minute, just as Simonides and his companions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>approached, Athenian and Spartan stood face to face, hand locked in hand, while
            Glaucon’s forehead grew redder, not with blushing. Then blood rushed to the king’s brow
            also. His fingers were crimson. They had been forced open. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euge!</span></span>”</span> cried the king, again; then, to Themistocles, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
              will do.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Whereupon, as if satisfied in his object and averse to further dalliance, he gave
            Cimon and his companions the stiffest of nods and deliberately turned on his heel.
            Speech was too precious coin for him to be wasted on mere adieus. Only over his shoulder
            he cast at Glaucon a curt mandate. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I hate Lycon. Grind his bones.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles, however, lingered a moment to greet Simonides. The little poet was
            delighted, despite overweening hopes, at the manly beauty yet modesty of the athlete,
            and being a man who kept his thoughts always near his tongue, made Glaucon blush more
            manfully than ever. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Master Simonides is overkind,”</span> had ventured the athlete; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I am sure his
              praise is only polite compliment.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps,”</span> insinuated Simonides, <span class="tei tei-q">“Themistocles was wrong yet again. Who knows if

            grotesquely tattooed, clear sign that he was a Thracian. His eyes twinkled keenly,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Evening was falling: the sea, rocks, fields, pine groves, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were touched by the red glow dying behind Acro-Corinthus. Torches gleamed
            amid the trees where the multitudes were buying, selling, wagering, making merry. All
            Greece seemed to have sent its wares to be disposed of at the Isthmia. Democrates idled
            along, now glancing at the huckster who displayed his painted clay dolls and urged the
            sightseers to remember the little ones at home. A wine-seller thrust a sample cup of a
            choice vintage under the Athenian’s nose, and vainly adjured him to buy. Thessalian
            easy-chairs, pottery, slaves kidnapped from the Black Sea, occupied one booth after
            another. On a pulpit before a bellowing crowd a pair of marionettes were rolling their
            eyes and gesticulating, as a woman pulled the strings. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there were more exalted entertainments. A rhapsodist stood on a pine stump
            chanting in excellent voice Alcæus’s hymn to Apollo. And more willingly the orator
            stopped on the edge of a throng of the better sort, which listened to a man of noble
            aspect reading in clear voice from his scroll. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Æschylus of Athens,”</span> whispered a bystander. <span class="tei tei-q">“He reads choruses of certain

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates knew the great dramatist well, but what he read was new—a <span class="tei tei-q">“Song of the
              Furies”</span> calling a terrific curse upon the betrayer of friendship. <span class="tei tei-q">“Some of his
              happiest lines,”</span> meditated Democrates, walking away, to be held a moment by the
            crowd around Lamprus the master-harpist. But now, feeling that he had dallied long
            enough, the orator turned his back on the two female acrobats who were swinging on a
            trapeze and struck down a long, straight road which led toward the distant cone of
            Acro-Corinthus. First, however, he turned on Bias, who all the time had been
            accompanying, dog-fashion. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates walked briskly out of the glare of the torches, then halted to slip the
            hood of his cloak up about his face. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The road is dark, but the wise man shuns accidents,”</span> was his reflection, as he
            strode in the direction pointed by Bias. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The way was dark. No moon; and even the brilliant starlight of summer in Hellas is an
            uncertain guide. Democrates knew he was traversing a long avenue lined by spreading
            cypresses, with a shimmer of white from some tall, sepulchral monument. Then through the
            dimness loomed the high columns of a temple, and close beside it pale light spread out
            upon the road as from an inn. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hegias’s inn,”</span> grumbled the Athenian. <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus grant it have no more fleas than

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At sound of his footsteps the door opened promptly, without knocking. A squalid scene
              revealed itself,—a white-washed room, an <a name="corr023" id="corr023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">earthen</span> floor, two clay lamps on a low table,
            a few stools,—but a tall, lean man in Oriental dress greeted the Athenian with a salaam
            which showed his own gold earrings, swarthy skin, and black mustache. </p>

            Lycon sat on a stool beside his guest, his Cyclops-like limbs sprawling down upon the

            by boxing gloves; but Democrates had a distinct feeling that under his battered visage
            and wiry black hair lurked greater penetration of human motive and more ability to play
            therewith than the chance observer might allow. The Athenian deliberately waited his

              influence over the Athenians. Therefore, as a loyal Athenian you must support your
              champion. Likewise, as a man of judgment you must see that I—though this pentathlon
              is only a by-play, not my business—will probably break your Glaucon’s back to-morrow.

            instant with unspeakable regret. But the Laconian sat before him, smiling, sneering,
            commanding by his more dominant will. The Athenian answered, it seemed, despite
            himself:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If it is not to betray Hellas.”</span>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And Democrates—perhaps the wine was strong—lifted his right hand and swore by Athena
            Polias of Athens he would betray no secret. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lycon arose with what was part bellow, part laugh. Even then the orator was moved to
            call back the pledge, but the Spartan acted too swiftly. The short moments which
            followed stamped themselves on Democrates’s memory. The flickering lamps, the squalid
            room, the long, dense shadows, the ungainly movements of the Spartan, who was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>opening a door,—all this passed after the manner of a
            vision. And as in a vision Democrates saw a stranger stepping through the inner portal,
            as at Lycon’s summons—a man of no huge stature, but masterful in eye and mien. Another
            Oriental, but not as the obsequious Hiram. Here was a lord to command and be obeyed.
            Gems flashed from the scarlet turban, the green jacket was embroidered with pearls—and
            was not half the wealth of Corinth in the jewels studding the sword hilt? Tight trousers
            and high shoes of tanned leather set off a form supple and powerful as a panther’s.
            Unlike most Orientals the stranger was fair. A blond beard swept his breast. His eyes
            were sharp, steel-blue. Never a word spoke he; but Democrates looked on him with wide
            eyes, then turned almost in awe to the Spartan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is a prince—”</span> he began. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“His Highness Prince Abairah of Cyprus,”</span> completed Lycon, rapidly, <span class="tei tei-q">“now come to
              visit the Isthmian Games, and later your Athens. It is for this I have brought you
              face to face—that he may be welcome in your city.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Athenian cast at the stranger a glance of keenest scrutiny. He knew by every
            instinct in his being that Lycon was telling a barefaced lie. Why he did not cry out as
            much that instant he hardly himself knew. But the gaze of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Cyprian”</span> pierced
            through him, fascinating, magnetizing, and Lycon’s great hand was on his victim’s
            shoulder. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Cyprian’s”</span> own hand went out seeking Democrates’s. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be very glad to see the noble Athenian in his own city. His fame for
              eloquence and prudence is already in Tyre and Babylon,”</span> spoke the stranger, never
            taking his steel-blue eyes from the orator’s face. The accent was Oriental, but the
            Greek was fluent. The prince—for prince he was, whatever his nation—pressed his hand
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>closer. Almost involuntarily Democrates’s hand
            responded. They clasped tightly; then, as if Lycon feared a word too much, the unknown
            released his hold, bowed with inimitable though silent courtesy, and was gone behind the
            door whence he had come. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It had taken less time than men use to count a hundred. The latch clicked. Democrates

            He had been partner in foulest treason. Duty to friend, duty to country,—oath or no
            oath,—should have sent him to Leonidas. What evil god had tricked him into that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In a tent at the lower end of the long stadium stood Glaucon awaiting the final
            summons to his ordeal. His friends had just cried farewell for the last time: Cimon had
            kissed him; Themistocles had gripped his hand; Democrates had called <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus prosper
              you!”</span> Simonides had vowed that he was already hunting for the metres of a triumphal
            ode. The roar from without told how the stadium was filled with its chattering
            thousands. The athlete’s trainers were bestowing their last officious advice. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spartan will surely win the quoit-throw. Do not be troubled. In everything else
              you can crush him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of Mœrocles of <a name="corr031" id="corr031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Mantinea</span>. He’s a knavish fellow; his backers are recalling

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon received this and much more admonition with his customary smile. There was no
            flush on the forehead, no flutter of the heart. A few hours later he would be crowned
            with all the glory which victory in the great games could throw about a Hellene, or be
            buried in the disgrace to which his ungenerous people consigned the vanquished. But, in
            the words of his day, <span class="tei tei-q">“he knew himself”</span> and his own powers. From the day he quitted
            boyhood he had never met the giant he could not master; the Hermes he could not out<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>run. He anticipated victory as a matter of course, even
            victory wrested from Lycon, and his thoughts seemed wandering far from the tawny track
            where he must face his foes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Athens,—my father,—my wife! I will win glory for them all!”</span> was the drift of his
            revery. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The younger rubber grunted under breath at his athlete’s vacant eye, but Pytheas, the
            older of the pair, whispered confidently that <span class="tei tei-q">“when he had known Master Glaucon
              longer, he would know that victories came his way, just by reaching out his hands.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Athena grant it,”</span> muttered the other. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ve got my half mina staked on him,
            too.”</span> Then from the tents at either side began the ominous call of the heralds:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Amyntas of Thebes, come you forth.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ctesias of Epidaurus, come you forth.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lycon of Sparta, come you forth.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon held out his hands. Each trainer seized one. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wish me joy and <a name="corr032" id="corr032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">honour</span>, good friends!”</span> cried the athlete. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Poseidon and Athena aid you!”</span> And Pytheas’s honest voice was husky. This was the
            greatest ordeal of his favourite pupil, and the trainer’s soul would go with him into
            the combat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon of Athens, come you forth.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The curtains of the tent swept aside. An intense sunlight sprang to meet the Athenian.
            He passed into the arena clad only in his coat of glistering oil. Scolus of Thasos and
            Mœrocles of Mantinea joined the other four athletes; then, escorted each by a herald
            swinging his myrtle wand, the six went down the stadium to the stand of the judges. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before the fierce light of a morning in Hellas beating down on him, Glaucon the
            Alcmæonid was for an instant blinded, and walked on passively, following his guide.
            Then, as from a dissolving mist, the huge stadium began to reveal itself: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>line above line, thousand above thousand of bright-robed
            spectators, a sea of faces, tossing arms, waving garments. A thunderous shout rose as
            the athletes came to view,—jangling, incoherent; each city cheered its champion and
            tried to cry down all the rest: applause, advice, derision. Glaucon heard the derisive
            hootings, <span class="tei tei-q">“pretty girl,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“pretty pullet,”</span> from the serried host of the Laconians along the left side of the
            stadium; but an answering salvo, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dog of Cerberus!”</span> bawled by the Athenian crowds
            opposite, and winged at Lycon, returned the taunts with usury. As the champions
            approached the judges’ stand a procession of full twenty pipers, attended by as many
            fair boys in flowing white, marched from the farther end of the stadium to meet them.
            The boys bore cymbals and tambours; the pipers struck up a brisk marching note in the
            rugged Dorian mode. The boys’ lithe bodies swayed in enchanting rhythm. The roaring
            multitude quieted, admiring their grace. The champions and the pipers thus came to the
            pulpit in the midst of the long arena. The president of the judges, a handsome
            Corinthian in purple and a golden fillet, swept his ivory wand from right to left. The
            marching note ceased. The whole company leaped as one man to its feet. The pipes, the
            cymbals were drowned, whilst twenty thousand voices—Doric, Bœotian, Attic—chorused
            together the hymn which all Greece knew: the hymn to Poseidon of the Isthmus, august
            guardian of the games. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Louder it grew; the multitude found one voice, as if it would cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are Hellenes
              all; though of many a city, the same fatherland, the same gods, the same hope against
              the Barbarian.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus in part. And in the hush thereafter the president poured a libation from a golden
            cup, praying, as the wine fell on the brazier beside him, to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Earth Shaker,”</span>
            seeking his blessing upon the contestants, the multitude, and upon broad Hellas. Next
            the master-herald announced that now, on the third day of the games, came the final and
            most honoured contest: the pentathlon, the fivefold struggle, with the crown to him who
            conquered thrice. He proclaimed the names of the six rivals, their cities, their
            ancestry, and how they had complied with the required training. The president took up
            his tale, and turning to the champions, urged them to strive their best, for the eyes of
            all Hellas were on them. But he warned any man with blood-guiltiness upon his soul not
            to anger the gods by continuing in the games. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“But since,”</span> the brief speech concluded, <span class="tei tei-q">“these men have chosen to contend, and
              have made oath that they are purified or innocent, let them join, and Poseidon shed
              fair glory upon the best!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More shouting; the pipers paraded the arena, blowing shriller than ever. Some of the
            athletes shifted uneasily. Scolus the Thasian—youngest of the six—was pale, and cast
            nervous glances at the towering bulk of Lycon. The Spartan gave him no heed, but threw a
            loud whisper at Glaucon, who stood silently beside him:— </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span>
          <a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“By Castor, son of Conon, you are extremely handsome. If fine looks won the battle, I
              might grow afraid.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Athenian, whose roving eye had just caught Cimon and Democrates in the audience,
            seemed never to hear him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And you are passing stalwart. Still, be advised. I wouldn’t harm you, so drop out
              early.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still no answer from Glaucon, whose clear eye seemed now to be wandering over the bare
            hills of Megara beyond. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No answer?”</span> persisted the giant. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eu!</span></span> don’t complain that
              you’ve lacked warning, when you sit to-night in Charon’s ferry-boat.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The least shadow of a smile flitted across the Athenian’s face; there was a slight
            deepening of the light in his eye. He turned his head a bit toward Lycon:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The games are not ended, dear Spartan,”</span> he observed quietly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The giant scowled. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t like you silent, smiling men! You’re warned. I’ll do my
              worst—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the leaping begin!”</span> rang the voice of the president,—a call that changed all
            the uproar to a silence in which one might hear the wind moving in the firs outside,
            while every athlete felt his muscles tighten. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The heralds ran down the soft sands to a narrow mound of hardened earth, and beckoned
            to the athletes to follow. In the hands of each contestant were set a pair of bronze
            dumb-bells. The six were arrayed upon the mound with a clear reach of sand before. The
            master-herald proclaimed the order of the leaping: that each contestant should spring
            twice, and he whose leaps were the poorest should drop from the other contests. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon stood, his golden head thrown back, his eyes wandering idly toward his friends
            in the stadium. He could see Cimon restless on his seat, and Simonides holding his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cloak and doubtless muttering wise counsel. The champion
            was as calm as his friends were nervous. The stadium had grown oppressively still; then
            broke into along <span class="tei tei-q">“ah!”</span> Twenty thousand sprang up together as Scolus the Thasian
            leaped. His partisans cheered, while he rose from a sand-cloud; but ceased quickly. His
            leap had been poor. A herald with a pick marked a line where he had landed. The pipers
            began a rollicking catch to which the athletes involuntarily kept time with their
            dumb-bells. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon leaped second. Even the hostile Laconians shouted with pleasure at sight of
            his beautiful body poised, then flung out upon the sands far beyond the Thasian. He
            rose, shook off the dust, and returned to the mound, with a graceful gesture to the
            cheer that greeted him; but wise heads knew the contest was just beginning. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Ctesias and Amyntas leaped beyond the Thasian’s mark, short of the Athenian’s. Lycon
            was fifth. His admirers’ hopes were high. He did not blast them. Huge was his bulk, yet
            his strength matched it. A cloud of dust hid him from view. When it settled, every
            Laconian was roaring with delight. He had passed beyond Glaucon. Mœrocles of Mantinea
            sprang last and badly. The second round was almost as the first; although Glaucon
            slightly surpassed his former effort. Lycon did as well as before. The others hardly
            bettered their early trial. It was long before the Laconians grew quiet enough to listen
            to the call of the herald. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lycon of Sparta wins the leaping. Glaucon of Athens is second. Scolus of Thasos leaps
              the shortest and drops from the pentathlon.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again cheers and clamour. The inexperienced Thasian marched disconsolately to his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The quoit-hurling follows,”</span> once more the herald; <span class="tei tei-q">“each contestant throws three
              quoits. He who throws poorest drops from the games.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cimon had risen now. In a momentary lull he trumpeted through his hands across the
            arena. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wake, Glaucon; quit your golden thoughts of Eleusis; Lycon is filching the crown.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles, seated near Cimon’s side, was staring hard, elbows on knees and head on
            hands. Democrates, next him, was gazing at Glaucon, as if the athlete were made of gold;
            but the object of their fears and hopes gave back neither word nor sign. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The attendants were arraying the five remaining champions at the foot of a little rise
            in the sand, near the judges’ pulpit. To each was brought a bronze quoit, the discus.
            The pipers resumed their medley. The second contest was begun. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> First, Amyntas of Thebes. He took his stand, measured the distance with his eye, then
            with a run flew up the rising, and at its summit his body bent double, while the heavy
            quoit flew away. A noble cast! and twice excelled. For a moment every Theban in the
            stadium was transported. Strangers sitting together fell on one another’s necks in sheer
            joy. But the rapture ended quickly. Lycon flung second. His vast strength could now tell
            to the uttermost. He was proud to display it. Thrice he hurled. Thrice his discus sped
            out as far as ever man had seen a quoit fly in Hellas. Not even Glaucon’s best wishers
            were disappointed when he failed to come within three cubits of the Spartan. Ctesias and
            Mœrocles realized their task was hopeless, and strove half heartedly. The friends of the
            huge Laconian were almost beside themselves with joy; while the herald called
            desperately that:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lycon of Sparta wins with the discus. Glaucon of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Athens is second. Ctesias of Epidaurus throws poorest and drops from the games.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wake, Glaucon!”</span> trumpeted Cimon, again his white face shining out amid the
            thousands of gazers now. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wake, or Lycon wins again and all is lost!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon was almost beyond earshot; to the frantic entreaty he answered by no sign. As
            he and the Spartan stood once more together, the giant leered on him civilly:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You grow wise, Athenian. It’s honour enough and to spare to be second, with Lycon
              first. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eu!</span></span>—and here’s the last contest.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I say again, good friend,”</span>—there was a slight closing of the Athenian’s lips, and
            deepening in his eyes,—<span class="tei tei-q">“the pentathlon is not ended.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The harpies eat you, then, if you get too bold! The herald is calling for the
              javelin-casting. Come,—it’s time to make an end.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But in the deep hush that spread again over the thousands Glaucon turned toward the
            only faces that he saw out of the innumerable host: Themistocles, Democrates, Simonides,
            Cimon. They beheld him raise his arm and lift his glorious head yet higher. Glaucon in
            turn saw Cimon sink into his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">“He wakes!”</span> was the appeased mutter passing from
            the son of Miltiades and running along every tier of Athenians. And silence deeper than
            ever held the stadium; for now, with Lycon victor twice, the literal turning of a finger
            in the next event might win or lose the parsley crown. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Spartan came first. The heralds had set a small scarlet shield at the lower end of
            the course. Lycon poised his light javelin thrice, and thrice the slim dart sped through
            the leathern thong on his fingers. But not for glory. Perchance this combat was too
            delicate an art for his ungainly hands. Twice the missile lodged in the rim of the
            shield; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>once it sprang beyond upon the sand. Mœrocles,
            who followed, surpassed him. Amyntas was hardly worse. Glaucon came last, and won his
            victory with a dexterous grace that made all but the hottest Laconian swell the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Io! paian!</span></span>”</span> of applause. His second cast had been into the
            centre of the target. His third had splintered his second javelin as it hung quivering. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon of Athens wins the javelin-casting. Mœrocles of Mantinea is second. Amyntas
              of Thebes is poorest and drops from the games.”</span> But who heard the herald now? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By this time all save the few Mantineans who vainly clung to their champion, and the
            Laconians themselves, had begun to pin their hopes on the beautiful son of Conon. There
            was a steely glint in the Spartan athlete’s eye that made the president of the games
            beckon to the master-herald. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lycon is dangerous. See that he does not do Glaucon a mischief, or transgress the
              rules.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I can, till they come to the wrestling.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“In that the god must aid the Athenian. But now let us have the foot-race.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the little respite following the trainers entered and rubbed down the three
            remaining contestants with oil until their bodies shone again like tinted ivory. Then
            the heralds conducted the trio to the southern end farthest from the tents. The two
            junior presidents left their pulpit and took post at either end of a line marked on the
            sand. Each held the end of a taut rope. The contestants drew lots from an urn for the
            place nearest the lower turning goal,—no trifling advantage. A favouring god gave
            Mœrocles the first; Lycon was second; Glaucon only third. As the three crouched before
            the rope with hands dug into the sand, waiting the fateful signal, Glaucon was conscious
            that a strange blond man of noble mien and Oriental dress was sitting close by the
            starting line and watching him intently. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span>
          <a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was one of those moments of strain, when even trifles can turn the overwrought
            attention. Glaucon knew that the stranger was looking from him to Lycon, from Lycon back
            to himself, measuring each with shrewd eye. Then the gaze settled on the Athenian. The
            Oriental called to him:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Swift, godlike runner, swift;”</span>—they were so close they could catch the Eastern
              accent—<span class="tei tei-q">“the Most High give you His wings!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon saw Lycon turn on the shouter with a scowl that was answered by a composed
            smile. To the highly strung imagination of the Athenian the wish became an omen of good.
            For some unknown cause the incident of the Oriental lad he rescued and the mysterious
            gift of the bracelet flashed back to him. Why should a stranger of the East cast him
            fair wishes? Would the riddle ever be revealed? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A trumpet blast. The Oriental, his wish, all else save the tawny track, flashed from
            Glaucon’s mind. The rope fell. The three shot away as one. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Over the sand they flew, moving by quick leaps, their shining arms flashing to and fro
            in fair rhythm. Twice around the stadium led the race, so no one strained at first. For
            a while the three clung together, until near the lower goal the Mantinean heedlessly
            risked a dash. His foot slipped on the sands. He recovered; but like arrows his rivals
            passed him. At the goal the inevitable happened. Lycon, with the shorter turn, swung
            quickest. He went up the homeward track ahead, the Athenian an elbow’s length behind.
            The stadium seemed dissolving in a tumult. Men rose; threw garments in the air;
            stretched out their arms; besought the gods; screamed to the runners. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Speed, son of Conon, speed!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glory to Castor; Sparta is prevailing!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Strive, Mantinean,—still a chance!”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span>
          <a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Win the turn, dear Athenian, the turn, and leave that Cyclops behind!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But at the upper turn Lycon still held advantage, and down the other track went the
            twain, even as Odysseus ran behind Ajax, <span class="tei tei-q">“who trod in Ajax’ footsteps ere ever the
              dust had settled, while on his head fell the breath of him behind.”</span> Again at the
            lower goal the Mantinean was panting wearily in the rear. Again Lycon led, again rose
            the tempest of voices. Six hundred feet away the presidents were stretching the line,
            where victory and the plaudits of Hellas waited Lycon of Lacedæmon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then men ceased shouting, and prayed under breath. They saw Glaucon’s shoulders bend
            lower and his neck strain back, while the sunlight sprang all over his red-gold hair.
            The stadium leaped to their feet, as the Athenian landed by a bound at his rival’s side.
            Quick as the bound the great arm of the Spartan flew out with its knotted fist. A deadly
            stroke, and shunned by a hair’s-breadth; but it was shunned. The senior president called
            angrily to the herald; but none heard his words in the rending din. The twain shot up
            the track elbow to elbow, and into the rope. It fell amid a blinding cloud of dust. All
            the heralds and presidents ran together into it. Then was a long, agonizing moment,
            while the stadium roared, shook, and raged, before the dust settled and the
            master-herald stood forth beckoning for silence. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon of Athens wins the foot-race. Lycon of Sparta is second. Mœrocles of Mantinea
              drops from the contest. Glaucon and Lycon, each winning twice, shall wrestle for the
              final victory.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now the stadium grew exceeding still. Men lifted their hands to their favourite
            gods, and made reckless, if silent, vows,—geese, pigs, tripods, even oxen,—if only the
            deity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would strengthen their favourite’s arm. For the
            first time attention was centred on the tall <span class="tei tei-q">“time pointer,”</span> by the judges’ stand,
            and how the short shadow cast by the staff told of the end of the morning. The last
            wagers were recorded on the tablets by nervous styluses. The readiest tongues ceased to
            chatter. Thousands of wistful eyes turned from the elegant form of the Athenian to the
            burly form of the Spartan. Every outward chance, so many an anxious heart told itself,
            favoured the oft-victorious giant; but then,—and here came reason for a true
              Hellene,—<span class="tei tei-q">“the gods could not suffer so fair a man to meet defeat.”</span> The noonday
            sun beat down fiercely. The tense stillness was now and then broken by the bawling of a
            swarthy hawker thrusting himself amid the spectators with cups and a jar of sour wine.
            There was a long rest. The trainers came forward again and dusted the two remaining
            champions with sand that they might grip fairly. Pytheas looked keenly in his pupil’s
            face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well begun is half done,’</span> my lad; but the hottest battle is still before,”</span>
            said he, trying to cover his own consuming dread. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Faint heart never won a city,”</span> smiled Glaucon, as if never more at ease; and
            Pytheas drew back happier, seeing the calm light in the athlete’s eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ay,”</span> he muttered to his fellow-trainer, <span class="tei tei-q">“all is well. The boy has wakened.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But now the heralds marched the champions again to the judges. The president
            proclaimed the rules of the wrestling,—two casts out of three gave victory. In lower
            tone he addressed the scowling Spartan:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lycon, I warn you: earn the crown only fairly, if you would earn it. Had that blow in
              the foot-race struck home, I would have refused you victory, though you finished all
              alone.”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span>
          <a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A surly nod was the sole answer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The heralds led the twain a little way from the judges’ stand, and set them ten paces
            asunder and in sight of all the thousands. The heralds stood, crossing their myrtle
            wands between. The president rose on his pulpit, and called through the absolute hush:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Prepared, Spartan?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Prepared, Athenian?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Then Poseidon shed glory on the best!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His uplifted wand fell. A clear shrill trumpet pealed. The heralds bounded back in a
            twinkling. In that twinkling the combatants leaped into each other’s arms. A short
            grapple; again a sand cloud; and both were rising from the ground. They had fallen
            together. Heated by conflict, they were locked again ere the heralds could proclaim a
            tie. Cimon saw the great arms of the Spartan twine around the Athenian’s chest in fair
            grapple, but even as Lycon strove with all his bull-like might to lift and throw,
            Glaucon’s slim hand glided down beneath his opponent’s thigh. Twice the Spartan put
            forth all his powers. Those nearest watched the veins of the athletes swell and heard
            their hard muscles crack. The stadium was in succession hushed and tumultuous. Then, at
            the third trial, even as Lycon seemed to have won his end, the Athenian smote out with
            one foot. The sands were slippery. The huge Laconian lunged forward, and as he lunged,
            his opponent by a masterly effort tore himself loose. The Spartan fell
            heavily,—vanquished by a trick, though fairly used. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stadium thundered its applause. More vows, prayers, exhortations. Glaucon stood
            and received all the homage in silence. A little flush was on his forehead. His arms and
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shoulders were very red. Lycon rose slowly. All could
            hear his rage and curses. The heralds ordered him to contain himself. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, fox of Athens,”</span> rang his shout, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will kill you!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Pytheas, beholding his fury, tore out a handful of hair in his mingled hope and dread.
            No man knew better than the trainer that no trick would conquer Lycon this second time;
            and Glaucon the Fair might be nearer the fields of Asphodel than the pleasant hills by
            Athens. More than one man had died in the last ordeal of the pentathlon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The silence was perfect. Even the breeze had hushed while Glaucon and Lycon faced
            again. The twenty thousand sat still as in their sepulchres, each saying in his heart
            one word—<span class="tei tei-q">“Now!”</span> If in the first wrestling the attack had been impetuous, it was
            now painfully deliberate. When the heralds’ wands fell, the two crept like mighty cats
            across the narrow sands, frames bent, hands outstretched, watching from the corners of
            their eyes a fair chance to rush in and grapple. Then Lycon, whose raging spirit had the
            least control, charged. Another dust cloud. When it cleared, the two were locked
            together as by iron. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For an instant they swayed, whilst the Spartan tried again his brute power. It failed
            him. Glaucon drew strength from the earth like Antæus. The hushed stadium could hear the
            pants of the athletes as they locked closer, closer. Strength failing, the Spartan
            snatched at his enemy’s throat; but the Athenian had his wrist gripped fast before the
            clasp could tighten, and in the melée Glaucon’s other hand passed beneath Lycon’s thigh.
            The two seemed deadlocked. For a moment they grinned face to face, almost close enough
            to bite each other’s lips. But breath was too precious for curses. The Spartan flung his
            ponderous weight downward. A slip in the gliding sand would have ruined the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Athenian instantly; but Poseidon or Apollo was with him. His
            feet dug deep, and found footing. Lycon drew back baffled, though the clutches of their
            hands were tightening like vices of steel. Then again face to face, swaying to and fro,
            panting, muttering, while the veins in the bare backs swelled still more. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He cannot endure it. He cannot! Ah! Athena Polias, pity him! Lycon is wearing him
              down,”</span> moaned Pytheas, beside himself with fear, almost running to Glaucon’s aid. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stadium resumed its roaring. A thousand conflicting prayers, hopes, counsels, went
            forth to the combatants. The gods of Olympus and Hades; all demigods, heroes, satyrs,
            were invoked for them. They were besought to conquer in the name of parents, friends,
            and native land. Athenians and Laconians, sitting side by side, took up the combat,
            grappling fiercely. And all this time the two strove face to face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> How long had it lasted? Who knew? Least of all that pair who wrestled perchance for
            life and for death. Twice again the Spartan strove with his weight to crush his opponent
            down. Twice vainly. He could not close his grip around the Athenian’s throat. He had
            looked to see Glaucon sink exhausted; but his foe still looked on him with steadfast,
            unweakening eyes. The president was just bidding the heralds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pluck them asunder and
              declare a tie!”</span> when the stadium gave a shrill long shout. Lycon had turned to his
            final resource. Reckless of his own hurt, he dashed his iron forehead against the
            Athenian’s, as bull charges bull. Twice and three times, and the blood leaped out over
            Glaucon’s fair skin. Again—the rush of blood was almost blinding. Again—Pytheas
            screamed with agony—the Athenian’s clutch seemed weakening. Again—flesh and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>blood could not stand such battering long. If Lycon could
            endure this, there was only one end to the pentathlon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Help thou me, Athena of the Gray Eyes! For the glory of Athens, my father, my
            wife!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The cry of Glaucon—half prayer, half battle-shout—pealed above the bellowing
            stadium. Even as he cried it, all saw his form draw upward as might Prometheus’s
            unchained. They saw the fingers of the Spartan unclasp. They saw his bloody face
            upturned and torn with helpless agony. They saw his great form totter, topple, fall. The
            last dust cloud, and into it the multitude seemed rushing together.... </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ... They caught Glaucon just as he fell himself. Themistocles was the first to kiss
            him. Little Simonides wept. Cimon, trying to embrace the victor, hugged in the confusion
            a dirty Platæan. Democrates seemed lost in the whirlpool, and came with greetings later.
            Perhaps he had stopped to watch that Oriental who had given Glaucon good wishes in the
            foot-race. The fairest praise, however, was from a burly man, who merely held out his
            hand and muttered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good!”</span> But this was from Leonidas. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Very late a runner crowned with pink oleanders panted up to the Athenian watch by
            Mount Icarus at the custom-house on the Megarian frontier. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The man fell breathless; but in a moment a clear beacon blazed upon the height. From a
            peak in Salamis another answered. In Eleusis, Hermippus the Noble was running to his
            daughter. In Peiræus, the harbour-town, the sailor folk were dancing about the
            market-place. In Athens, archons, generals, and elders were accompanying Conon to the
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Acropolis to give thanks to Athena. Conon had
            forgotten how he had disowned his son. Another beacon glittered from the Acropolis.
            Another flashed from the lordly crest of Pentelicus, telling the news to all Attica.
            There was singing in the fishers’ boats far out upon the bay. In the goat-herds’ huts on
            dark Hymethus the pan-pipes blew right merrily. Athens spent the night in almost drunken
            joy. One name was everywhere:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A cluster of white stuccoed houses with a craggy hill behind, and before them a blue
            bay girt in by the rocky isle of Salamis—that is Eleusis-by-the-Sea. Eastward and
            westward spreads the teeming Thrasian plain, richest in Attica. Behind the plain the
            encircling mountain wall fades away into a purple haze. One can look southward toward
            Salamis; then to the left rises the rounded slope of brown Pœcilon sundering Eleusis
            from its greater neighbour, Athens. Look behind: there is a glimpse of the long violet
            crests of Cithæron and Parnes, the barrier mountains against Bœotia. Look to right:
            beyond the summits of Megara lifts a noble cone. It is an old friend, Acro-Corinthus.
            The plain within the hills is sprinkled with thriving farmsteads, green vineyards,
            darker olive groves. The stony hill-slopes are painted red by countless poppies. One
            hears the tinkling of the bells of roving goats. Thus the more distant view; while at
            the very foot of the hill of vision rises a temple with proud columns and
            pediments,—the fane of Demeter the <span class="tei tei-q">“Earth Mother”</span> and the seat of her Mysteries,
            renowned through Hellas. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The house of Hermippus the Eumolpid, first citizen of Eleusis, stood to the east of
            the temple. On three sides gnarled trunks and sombre leaves of the sacred olives almost
            hid the white low walls of the rambling buildings. On the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fourth side, facing the sea, the dusty road wound east toward Megara.
            Here, by the gate, were gathered a rustic company: brown-faced village lads and lasses,
            toothless graybeards, cackling old wives. Above the barred gate swung a festoon of ivy,
            whilst from within the court came the squeaking of pipes, the tuning of citharas, and
            shouted orders—signs of a mighty bustling. Then even while the company grew, a
            half-stripped courier flew up the road and into the gate. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They come,”</span> ran the wiseacre’s comment; but their buzzing ceased, as again the
            gate swung back to suffer two ladies to peer forth. Ladies, in the truth, for the twain
            had little in common with the ogling village maids, and whispers were soon busy with
            them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Look—his wife and her mother! How would you, Praxinœ, like to marry an
            Isthmionices?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Excellently well, but your Hermas won’t so honour you.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eu!</span></span> see, she lifts her pretty blue veil; I’m glad she’s
              handsome. Some beautiful men wed regular hags.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The two ladies were clearly mother and daughter, of the same noble height, and dressed
            alike in white. Both faces were framed in a flutter of Amorgos gauze: the mother’s was
            saffron, crowned with a wreath of golden wheat-ears; the daughter’s blue with a circlet
            of violets. And now as they stood with arms entwined the younger brushed aside her veil.
            The gossips were right. The robe and the crown hid all but the face and tress of the
            lustrous brown hair,—but that face! Had not King Hephæstos wrought every line of clear
            Phœnician glass, then touched them with snow and rose, and shot through all the ichor of
            life? Perhaps there was a fitful fire in the dark eyes that awaited the husband’s
            coming, or a slight twitching of the impatient lips. But nothing disturbed the high-born
            repose of face and figure. Hermione was indeed the worthy daughter of a noble <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>house, and happy the man who was faring homeward to
            Eleusis! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another messenger. Louder bustle in the court, and the voice of Hermippus arraying his
            musicians. Now a sharp-faced man, who hid his bald pate under a crown of lilies, joined
            the ladies,—Conon, father of the victor. He had ended his life-feud with Hermippus the
            night the message flashed from Corinth. Then a third runner; this time in his hand a
            triumphant palm branch, and his one word—<span class="tei tei-q">“Here!”</span> A crash of music answered from
            the court, while Hermippus, a stately nobleman, his fine head just sprinkled with gray,
            led out his unmartial army. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Single pipes and double pipes, tinkling lyres and many-stringed citharas, not to
            forget herdsmen’s reed flutes, cymbals, and tambours, all made melody and noise
            together. An imposing procession that must have crammed the courtyard wound out into the
            Corinth road. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Here was the demarch<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> of Eleusis, a pompous worthy, who could hardly hold his head erect,
            thanks to an exceeding heavy myrtle wreath. After him, two by two, the snowy-robed,
            long-bearded priests of Demeter; behind these the noisy corps of musicians, and then a
            host of young men and women,—bright of eye, graceful of movement,—twirling long chains
            of ivy, laurel, and myrtle in time to the music. Palm branches were everywhere. The
            procession moved down the road; but even as it left the court a crash of cymbals through
            the olive groves answered its uproar. Deep now and sonorous sounded manly voices as in
            some triumphal chant. Hermione, as she stood by the gate, drew closer to her mother.
            Inflexible Attic custom seemed to hold her fast. No noblewoman might thrust herself
            boldly under the public eye—save at a sacred festival—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>no, not when the centre of the gladness was her husband. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He comes!”</span> So she cried to her mother; so cried every one. Around the turn in the
            olive groves swung a car in which Cimon stood proudly erect, and at his side another.
            Marching before the chariot were Themistocles, Democrates, Simonides; behind followed
            every Athenian who had visited the Isthmia. The necks of the four horses were wreathed
            with flowers; flowers hid the reins and bridles, the chariot, and even its wheels. The
            victor stood aloft, his scarlet cloak flung back, displaying his godlike form. An
            unhealed scar marred his forehead—Lycon’s handiwork; but who thought of that, when
            above the scar pressed the wreath of wild parsley? As the two processions met, a cheer
            went up that shook the red rock of Eleusis. The champion answered with his frankest
            smile; only his eyes seemed questioning, seeking some one who was not there. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Io! Glaucon!”</span> The Eleusinian youths broke from their ranks and fell upon the
            chariot. The horses were loosed in a twinkling. Fifty arms dragged the car onward. The
            pipers swelled their cheeks, each trying to outblow his fellow. Then after them sped the
            maidens. They ringed the chariot round with a maze of flowers chains. As the car moved,
            they accompanied it with a dance of unspeakable ease, modesty, grace. A local poet—not
            Simonides, not Pindar, but some humbler bard—had invoked his muse for the grand
            occasion. Youths and maidens burst forth into singing. </p>

            number, till the parsley wreath was hidden from sight. Near the gate of Hermippus the
            jubilant company halted. The demarch bawled long for silence, won it at last, and
            approached the chariot. He, good man, had been a long day meditating on his speech of
            formal congratulation and enjoyed his opportunity. Glaucon’s eyes still roved and
            questioned, yet the demarch rolled out his windy sentences. But there was something
            unexpected. Even as the magistrate took breath after reciting the victor’s noble
            ancestry, there was a cry, a parting of the crowd, and Glaucon the Alcmæonid leaped from
            the chariot as never on the sands at Corinth. The veil and the violet wreath fell from
            the head of Hermione when her face went up to her husband’s. The blossoms that had
            covered the athlete shook over her like a cloud as his face met hers. Then even the
            honest demarch cut short his eloquence to swell the salvo. </p>

            chosen guests in a more private chamber. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing to excess”</span> was the truly Hellenic
            maxim of the refined Eleusinian; and he obeyed it. His banquet was elegant without
            gluttony. The Syracusan cook had prepared a lordly turbot. The wine was choice old Chian
            but well diluted. There was no vulgar gorging with meat, after the Bœotian manner; but
            the great Copaic eel, <span class="tei tei-q">“such as Poseidon might have sent up to Olympus,”</span> made every
            gourmand clap his hands. The aromatic honey was the choicest from Mt. Hymettus. </p>

            present. Hermione sat on a wide chair beside Lysistra, her comely mother; her younger
            brothers on stools at either hand. Directly across the narrow table Glaucon and
            Democrates reclined on the same couch. The eyes of husband and wife seldom left each
            other; their tongues flew fast; they never saw how Democrates hardly took his gaze from
            the face of Hermione. Simonides, who reclined beside Themistocles,—having struck a firm
            friendship with that statesman on very brief acquaintance,—was overrunning with humour
            and anecdote. The great man beside him was hardly his second in the fence of wit and
            wisdom. After the fish had given way to the wine, Simonides regaled the company with a
            gravely related story of how the Dioscuri had personally appeared to him during his last
            stay in Thessaly and saved him from certain death in a falling building. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You swear this is a true tale, Simonides?”</span> began Themistocles, with one eye in his

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am no singer or harpist,”</span> returned the statesman, with a self-complacency he
            never concealed. <span class="tei tei-q">“I only know how to make Athens powerful.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cimon, with due excuses, arose, called for a harp, and began tuning it; but not all
            the company were destined to hear him. A slave-boy touched Themistocles on the shoulder,
            and the latter started to go. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Quite other gods,”</span> rejoined the statesman; <span class="tei tei-q">“your pardon, Cimon, I return in a
              moment. An agent of mine is back from Asia, surely with news of weight, if he must

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Themistocles lingered outside; an instant more brought a summons to Democrates,
            who found Themistocles in an antechamber, deep in talk with Sicinnus,—nominally the
            tutor of his sons, actually a trusted spy. The first glance at the Asiatic’s keen face
            and eyes was disturbing. An inward omen—not from the entrails of birds, nor a sign in
            the heavens—told Democrates the fellow brought no happy tidings. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With incisive questions Themistocles had been bringing out everything. </p>

              Thebes is Medizing, Crete is Medizing, so is Argos. Thessaly is wavering. I can almost

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When Democrates returned to the hall, Cimon had ended his song. The guests were
            applauding furiously. Wine was still going round, but Glaucon and Hermione were not
            joining. Across the table they were conversing in low sentences that Democrates could
            not catch. But he knew well enough the meaning as each face flashed back the beauty of
            the other. And his mind wandered back darkly to the day when Glaucon had come to him,
            more radiant than even his wont, and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me joy, dear comrade, joy! Hermippus
              has promised me the fairest maiden in Athens.”</span> Some evil god had made Democrates
            blind to all his boon-companion’s wooing. How many hopes of the orator that day had been
            shattered! Yet he had even professed to rejoice with the son of Conon.... He sat in
            sombre silence, until the piping voice of Simonides awakened him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He spent the rest of the feast drinking deeply, and with much forced laughter. The

            the victor toward Athens. At Daphni, the pass over the hills, the archons and
            strategi—highest officials of the state—met them with cavalry and torches and half of
            the city trailing at their heels. Twenty cubits of the city wall were pulled down to
            make a gate for the triumphal entry. There was another great feast at the government
            house. The purse of an hundred drachmæ, due by law to Isthmian victors, was presented. A
            street was named for Glaucon in the new port-town of Peiræus. Simonides recited a
            triumphal ode. All Athens, in short, made merry for days. Only one man found it hard to
            join the mirth whole-heartedly. And this was the victor’s bosom friend,—Democrates.

            wicker booth beside the line of Hermes-busts in the midst of the square. <span class="tei tei-q">“Buy my
              charcoal!”</span> roared back a companion, whilst past both was haled a grinning negro
            with a crier who bade every gentleman to <span class="tei tei-q">“mark his chance”</span> for a fashionable
            servant. Phocian the quack was hawking his toothache salve from the steps of the Temple
            of Apollo. Deira, the comely flower girl, held out crowns of rose, violet, and narcissus
            to the dozen young dandies who pressed about her. Around the Hermes-busts idle crowds
            were reading the legal notices plastered on the base of each statue. A file of mules and
            wagons was plough<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing through the multitude with marble
            for some new building. Every instant the noise grew. Pandora’s box had opened, and every
            clamour had flitted out. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the northern end, where the porticos and the long Dromos street ran off toward the
            Dipylon gate, stood the shop of Clearchus the potter. A low counter was covered with the
            owner’s wares,—tall amphoræ for wine, flat beakers,
            <a name="corr063" id="corr063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">water-pots</span>, and basins. Behind, two
            apprentices whirled the wheel, another glazed on the black varnish and painted the jars
            with little red loves and dancing girls. Clearchus sat on the counter with three
            friends,—come not to trade but to barter the latest gossip from the barber-shops: Agis
            the sharp, knavish cockpit and gaming-house keeper, Crito the fat mine-contractor, and
            finally Polus, gray and pursy, who <span class="tei tei-q">“devoted his talents to the public weal,”</span> in
            other words was a perpetual juryman and likewise busybody. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The latest rumour about Xerxes having been duly chewed, conversation began to lag. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“An idle day for you, my Polus,”</span> threw out Clearchus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Idle indeed! No jury sits to-day in the King Archon’s Porch or the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Red Court’</span>;
              I can’t vote to condemn that Heraclius who’s exported wheat contrary to the law.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Condemn?”</span> cried Agis; <span class="tei tei-q">“wasn’t the evidence very weak?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ay,”</span> snorted Polus, <span class="tei tei-q">“very weak, and the wretch pleaded piteously, setting his
              wife and four little ones weeping on the stand. But we are resolved. <span class="tei tei-q">‘You are
                boiling a stone—your plea’s no profit,’</span> thought we. Our hearts vote <span class="tei tei-q">‘guilty,’</span> if our heads say <span class="tei tei-q">‘innocent.’</span> One mustn’t discourage honest
              informers. What’s a patriot on a jury for if only to acquit? Holy Father Zeus, but
              there’s a pleasure in dropping into the voting-urn the black bean which condemns!”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Athena keep us, then, from litigation,”</span> murmured Clearchus; while Crito opened his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Agis gave a whistle. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The men are much alike in build,”</span> spoke Crito, slowly, <span class="tei tei-q">“only Glaucon is
              infinitely handsomer.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And infinitely less honest. I distrust your too beautiful and too lucky men,”</span>
            snapped Polus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Envious dog,”</span> commented Agis; and bitter personalities might have followed had not
            a bell jangled from an adjacent portico. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Phormio, my brother-in-law, with fresh fish from Phaleron,”</span> announced Polus,
            drawing a coin from his wonted purse,—his cheek; <span class="tei tei-q">“quick, friends, we must buy our
              dinners.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Between the columns of the portico stood Phormio the fishmonger, behind a table heaped
              with his scaly wares. He was a thick, florid man with blue eyes lit by a
              <a name="corr065" id="corr065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">humourous</span>
            twinkle. His arms were crusted with brine. To his waist he was naked. As the friends
            edged nearer he held up a turbot, calling for a bid. A clamour answered him. The throng
            pressed up the steps, elbowing and scrambling. The competition was keen but
            good-natured. Phormio’s broad jests and witticisms—he called all his customers by
            name—aided in forcing up the price. The turbot was knocked down to a rich gentleman’s
            cook marketing for his master. The pile of fish decreased, the bidding sharpened. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Market Wardens”</span> seemed needed to check the jostling. But as the last eel was held
            up, came a cry— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Look out for the rope!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Phormio’s customers scattered. Scythian constables were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stretching cords dusted with red chalk across all exits from the Agora,
            save that to the south. Soon the band began contracting its nets and driving a swarm of
            citizens toward the remaining exit, for a red chalk-mark on a mantle meant a fine.
            Traffic ceased instantly. Thousands crowded the lane betwixt the temples and porches,
            seeking the assembly place,—through a narrow, ill-built way, but the great area of the
            Pnyx opened before them like the slopes of some noble theatre. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No seats; rich and poor sat down upon the rocky ground. Under the open azure, at the
            focus of the semicircle, with clear view before of the city, and to right of the red
            cliffs of the Acropolis, rose a low platform hewn in the rock,—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Bema,”</span> the
            orator’s pulpit. A few chairs for the magistrates and a small altar were its sole
            furnishings. The multitude entered the Pnyx through two narrow entrances pierced in the
            massy engirdling wall and took seats at pleasure; all were equals—the Alcmæonid, the
            charcoal-seller from Acharnæ. Amid silence the chairman of the Council arose and put on
            the myrtle crown,—sign that the sitting was opened. A herald besought blessings on the
            Athenians and the Platæans their allies. A wrinkled seer carefully slaughtered a goose,
            proclaimed that its entrails gave good omen, and cast the carcass on the altar. The
            herald assured the people there was no rain, thunder, or other unlucky sign from heaven.
            The pious accordingly breathed easier, and awaited the order of the day. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The decree of the Council convening the assembly was read; then the herald’s formal
            proclamation:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who wishes to speak?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The answer was a groan from nigh every soul present. Three men ascended the Bema. They
            bore the olive branches and laurel garlands, suppliants at Delphi; but their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cloaks were black. <span class="tei tei-q">“The oracle is unfavourable! The gods
              deliver us to Xerxes!”</span> The thrill of horror went around the Pnyx. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The three stood an instant in gloomy silence. Then Callias the Rich, solemn and
            impressive, their spokesman, told their eventful story. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Athenians, by your orders we have been to Delphi to inquire of the surest oracle in
              Greece your destinies in the coming war. Hardly had we completed the accustomed
              sacrifices in the Temple of Apollo, when the Pythoness Aristonice, sitting above the
              sacred cleft whence comes the inspiring vapour, thus prophesied.”</span> And Callias
            repeated the hexameters which warned the Athenians that resistance to Xerxes would be
            worse than futile; that Athens was doomed; concluding with the fearful line, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get from
              this temple afar, and brood on the ills that await ye.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the pause, as Callias’s voice fell, the agony of the people became nigh
            indescribable. Sturdy veterans who had met the Persian spears at Marathon blinked fast.
            Many groaned, some cursed. Here and there a bold spirit dared to open his heart to
            doubt, and to mutter, <span class="tei tei-q">“Persian gold, the Pythoness was corrupted,”</span> but quickly
            hushed even such whispers as rank impiety. Then a voice close to the Bema rang out
            loudly:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And is this all the message, Callias?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The voice of Glaucon the Fortunate,”</span> cried many, finding relief in words. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is
              a friend to the ambassador. There is a further prophecy.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The envoy, who had made his theatrical pause too long, continued:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Such, men of Athens, was the answer; and we went forth in dire tribulation. Then a
              certain noble Delphian, Timon by name, bade us take the olive branches and return to
              the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Pythoness, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘O King Apollo, reverence
                these boughs of supplication, and deliver a more comfortable answer concerning our
                dear country. Else we will not leave thy sanctuary, but stay here until we die.’</span>
              Whereat the priestess gave us a second answer, gloomy and riddling, yet not so evil as
              the first.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again Callias recited his lines of doom, <span class="tei tei-q">“that Athena had vainly
              prayed to Zeus in behalf of her city, and that it was fated the foe should overrun all
              Attica, yet</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“That is all,”</span> and Callias quitted the Bema. Whereupon if agony had held the Pnyx

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Salamis?”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A great battle, but who is to conquer?”</span> The feverish anxiety of the people at
            length found its vent in a general shout. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The seers! Call the seers! Explain the oracle!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The demand had clearly been anticipated by the president of the Council. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Xenagoras the Cerycid is present. He is the oldest seer. Let us hearken to his

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The head of the greatest priestly family in Athens arose. He was a venerable man,
            wearing his ribbon-decked robes of office. The president passed him the myrtle crown, as
            token that he had the Bema. In a tense hush his voice sounded clearly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I was informed of the oracles before the assembly met. The meaning is plain. By the
                <span class="tei tei-q">‘wooden wall’</span> is meant our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ships. But if we
              risk a battle, we are told slaughter and defeat will follow. The god commands,
              therefore, that without resistance we quit Attica, gathering our wives, our children,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xenagoras paused with the smile of him who performs a sad but necessary duty, removed
            the wreath, and descended the Bema. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Quit Attica without a blow! Our fathers’ fathers’ sepulchres, the shrines of our

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The thought shot chill through the thousands. Men sat in helpless silence, while many
            a soul, as the gaze wandered up to the temple-crowned Acropolis, asked once, yes twice,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not the yoke of Persia preferable to that?”</span> Then after the silence broke the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“All the priests and seers of Attica have consulted. Xenagoras speaks for them all

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Confusion followed. Men rose, swung their arms, harangued madly from where they stood.
            The chairman in vain ordered <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence!”</span> and was fain to bid the Scythian constables
            restore order. An elderly farmer thrust himself forward, took the wreath, and poured out
            his rustic wisdom from the Bema. His advice was simple. The oracle said <span class="tei tei-q">“the wooden
              wall”</span> would be a bulwark, and by the wooden wall was surely meant the Acropolis
            which had once been protected by a palisade. Let all Attica shut itself in the citadel
            and endure a siege. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Go down! go down!”</span> pealed the yell, emphasized by a shower of pebbles. The elder
            tore the wreath from his head and fled the Bema. Then out of the confusion came a
            general cry. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Cimon, son of Miltiades, speak to us!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But that young nobleman preserved a discreet silence, and the multitude turned to
            another favourite. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Democrates, son of Myscelus, speak to us!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The popular orator only wrapped his cloak about him, as he sat near the chairman’s
            stand, never answering the call he rejoiced of wont to hear. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There were cries for Hermippus, cries even for Glaucon, as if prowess in the
            pentathlon gave ability to unravel oracles. The athlete sitting beside Democrates merely
            blushed and drew closer to his friend. Then at last the despairing people turned to
            their last resource. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Themistocles, son of Neocles, speak to us!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thrice the call in vain; but at the fourth time a wave of silence swept across the
            Pnyx. A figure well beloved was taking the wreath and mounting the Bema. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The words of Themistocles that day were to ring in his hearer’s ears till life’s end.
            The careless, almost sybaritic, man of the Isthmus and Eleusis seemed transfigured. For
            one moment he stood silent, lofty, awe-inspiring. He had a mighty task: to calm the
            superstitious fears of thirty thousand, to silence the prophets of evil, to infuse those
            myriads with his own high courage. He began with a voice so low it would have seemed a
            whisper if not audible to all the Pnyx. Quickly he warmed. His gestures became dramatic.
            His voice rose to a trumpet-call. He swept his hearers with him as dry leaves before the
            blast. <span class="tei tei-q">“When he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>began to weave his words, one might
              have deemed him churlish, nay a fool, but when from his chest came his deep voice, and
              words like unto flakes of winter snow, then who could with him contend?”</span> Thus Homer
            of Odysseus the Guileful, thus as truly of Themistocles saviour of Hellas. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> First he told the old, but never wearisome story of the past of Athens. How, from the
            days of Codrus long ago, Athens had never bowed the knee to an invader, how she had
            wrested Salamis from greedy Megara, how she had hounded out the tyrannizing sons of
            Peisistratus, how she had braved all the wrath of Persian Darius and dashed his huge
            armament back at Marathon. With such a past, only a madman as well as traitor would
            dream of submitting to Xerxes now. But as for the admonition of Xenagoras to quit Attica
            and never strike a blow, Themistocles would have none of it. With a clearness that
            appealed to every home-loving Hellene he pictured the fate of wanderers as only one step
            better than that of slaves. What, then, was left? The orator had a decisive answer. Was
            not the <span class="tei tei-q">“wooden wall”</span> which should endure for the Athenians the great fleet they
            were just completing? And as for the fate of the battle the speaker had an unexpected
            solution. <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Salamis,”</span> spoke the Pythoness. And would she have said <span class="tei tei-q">“holy,”</span>
            if the issue had been only woe to the sons of Athens? <span class="tei tei-q">“Luckless Salamis”</span> were then
            more reasonably the word; yet the prophetess so far from predicting defeat had assured
            them victory. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus ran the substance of the speech on which many a soul knew hung the mending or
            ending of Hellas, but lit all through with gleams of wit, shades of pathos, outbursts of
            eloquence which burned into the hearers’ hearts as though the speaker were a god. Then
            at the end, Themistocles, knowing his audience was with him, delivered his peroration:— </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span>
          <a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let him who trusts in oracles trust then in this, and in the old
              prophecy of Epimenides that when the Persian comes it is to his hurt. But I will say
              with Hector of Troy, <span class="tei tei-q">‘One oracle is best—to fight for one’s native country.’</span>
              Others may vote as they will. My vote is that if the foe by land be too great, we
              retire before him to our ships, ay, forsake even well-loved Attica, but only that we
              may trust to the <span class="tei tei-q">‘wooden wall,’</span> and fight the Great King by sea at Salamis. We
              contend not with gods but with men. Let others fear. I will trust to Athena
              Polias,—the goddess terrible in battle. Hearken then to Solon the Wise (the orator
              pointed toward the temple upon the soaring Acropolis):—</span>

            was carried with a shout. Men ran to Themistocles, calling him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peitho,—Queen
              Persuasion.”</span> He made light of their praises, and walked with his handsome head
            tossed back toward the general’s office by the Agora, to attend to some routine
            business. Glaucon, Cimon, and Democrates went westward to calm their exhilaration with a
            ball-game at the gymnasium of Cynosarges. On the way Glaucon called attention to a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the northern quarter of Athens the suburb of Alopece thrust itself under the slopes
            of Mt. Lycabettus, that pyramid of tawny rock which formed the rear bulwark, as it were,
            of every landscape of Athens. The dwellings in the suburb were poor, though few even in
            the richer quarters were at all handsome; the streets barely sixteen feet wide,
            ill-paved, filthy, dingy. A line of dirty gray stucco house-fronts was broken only by
            the small doors and the smaller windows in the second story. Occasionally a two-faced
            bust of Hermes stood before a portal, or a marble lion’s head spouted into a corner
            water trough. All Athenian streets resembled these. The citizen had his Pnyx, his
            Jury-Court, his gossiping Agora for his day. These dingy streets sufficed for the dogs,
            the slaves, and the women, whom wise Zeus ordered to remain at home. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Phormio the fishmonger had returned from his traffic, and sat in his house-door
            meditating over a pot of sour wine and watching the last light flickering on the great
            bulk of the mountain. He had his sorrows,—good man,—for Lampaxo his worthy wife, long
            of tongue, short of temper, thrifty and very watchful, was reminding him for the seventh
            time that he had sold a carp half an obol too cheap. His patience indeed that evening
            was so near to exhaustion that after <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cursing inwardly
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“match-maker”</span> who had saddled this Amazon upon him, he actually found courage

            his betters. The short southern twilight was swiftly passing into night. Groups of young

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Despite the cane, Clearchus was right. The visitor was Democrates. The orator mounted
            the dark stair above the shield-factory and knocked against a door, calling, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pai! Pai!</span></span>”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Boy! boy!”</span> a summons answered by none other than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the ever smiling Hiram. The Athenian, however, was little prepared for the luxury, nay
            splendour, which greeted him, once the Phœnician had opened the door. The bare chamber
            had been transformed. The foot sank into the glowing carpets of Kerman and Bactria. The
            gold-embroidered wall tapestries were of Sidonian purple. The divans were covered with
            wondrous stuff which Democrates could not name,—another age would call it silk. A
            tripod smoked with fragrant Arabian frankincense. Silver lamps, swinging from silver
            chains, gave brilliant light. The Athenian stood wonderbound, until a voice, not
            Hiram’s, greeted him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Welcome, Athenian,”</span> spoke the Cyprian, in his quaint, eastern accent. It was the
            strange guest in the tavern by Corinth. The Prince—prince surely, whatever his other
            title—was in the same rich dress as at the Isthmus, only his flowing beard had been
            dyed raven black. Yet Democrates’s eyes were diverted instantly to the peculiarly
            handsome slave-boy on the divan beside his master. The boy’s dress, of a rare blue
            stuff, enveloped him loosely. His hair was as golden as the gold thread on the round
            cap. In the shadows the face almost escaped the orator,—he thought he saw clear blue
            eyes and a marvellously brilliant, almost girlish, bloom and freshness. The presence of
            this slave caused the Athenian to hesitate, but the Cyprian bade him be seated, with one
            commanding wave of the hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is Smerdis, my constant companion. He is a mute. Yet if otherwise, I would trust

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates, putting by surprise, began to look on his host fixedly. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not anxious,”</span> observed the Prince, composedly. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Hiram is watchful and skilful. You see I have dyed my hair and beard

              say in Athens.”</span> Democrates’s smile was not wholly agreeable. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“With all except you,”</span> assented the Prince, fingering the scarlet tassel of the
            cushion whereon he sat. <span class="tei tei-q">“I reckoned confidently that you would come to visit me when I
              sent Hiram to you. Yes—I have heard the story that is on your tongue: one of
              Themistocles’s busybodies has brought a rumour that a certain great man of the Persian
              court is missing from the side of his master, and you have been requested to greet
              that nobleman heartily if he should come to Athens.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You know a great deal!”</span> cried the orator, feeling his forehead grow hot. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is pleasant to know a great deal,”</span> smiled back the Prince, carelessly, while
            Hiram entered with a tray and silver goblets brimming with violet-flavoured sherbet; <span class="tei tei-q">“I have innumerable <span class="tei tei-q">‘Eyes-and-ears.’</span> You have heard the name? One of the chief
              officers of his Majesty is <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Royal Eye.’</span> You Athenians are a valiant and in
              many things a wise people, yet you could grow in wisdom by looking well to the
            East.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am confident,”</span> exclaimed Democrates, thrusting back the goblet, <span class="tei tei-q">“if your
              Excellency requires a noble game of wits, you can have one. I need only step to the
              window, and cry <span class="tei tei-q">‘Spies!’</span>—after which your Excellency can exercise your wisdom
              and eloquence defending your life before one of our Attic juries.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Which is a polite and patriotic manner of saying, dearest Athenian, you are not
              prepared to push matters to such unfortunate extremity. I omit what his Majesty might
              do in the way of taking vengeance; sufficient that if aught unfor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tunate befalls me, or Hiram, or this my slave Smerdis, while we are in
              Athens, a letter comes to your noble chief Themistocles from the banker Pittacus of

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates, who had risen to his feet, had been flushed before. He became pale now.
            The hand that clutched the purple tapestry was trembling. The words rose to his lips,
            the lips refused to utter them. The Prince, who had delivered his threat most quietly,
            went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“In short, good Democrates, I was aware before I came to Athens of our
              necessities, and I came because I was certain I could relieve them.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Never!”</span> The orator shot the word out desperately. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are a Hellene.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not, however, affect to be more virtuous than your race. Persians make their boast

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The orator’s breath came deep. His hands clasped and unclasped, then were pressed

              but he left you no large estate. You were ambitious to shine as an orator and leader
              of the Athenians. To win popularity you have given great feasts. At the last festival
              of the Theseia you fed the poor of Athens on sixty oxen washed down with good Rhodian

              beat back my master. Worse still, you have squandered many minæ on flute girls, dice,
              cock-fights, and other gentle pleasures. In short your patrimony is not merely

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was on the threshold, when the slave-boy touched his master’s hand in silent

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Why did Democrates feel his forehead turn to flame? Why—almost against will—did he
            stretch forth his hand to the Cyprian? He went down the stair scarce feeling the steps
            beneath him. At the bottom voices greeted him from across the darkened street. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A fair evening, Master Glaucon.”</span>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He had not far to go. Athens was compactly built, all quarters close together. Yet
            before he reached home and bed, he was fighting back an ill-defined but terrible
            thought. <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon! They think I am Glaucon. If I chose to betray the Cyprian—”</span>
            Further than that he would not suffer the thought to go. He lay sleepless, fighting
            against it. The dark was full of the harpies of uncanny suggestion. He arose
            unrefreshed, to proffer every god the same prayer: <span class="tei tei-q">“Deliver me from evil imaginings.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Acropolis of Athens rises as does no other citadel in the world. Had no workers in
            marble or bronze, no weavers of eloquence or song, dwelt beneath its shadow, it would
            stand the centre and cynosure of a remarkable landscape. It is <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
                Rock</span></span>,”</span> no other like unto it. Is it enough to say its ruddy limestone rises
            as a huge boulder one hundred and fifty feet above the plain, that its breadth is five
            hundred, its length one thousand? Numbers and measures can never disclose a soul,—and
            the Rock of Athens has all but a soul: a soul seems to glow through its adamant when the
            fire-footed morning steals over the long crest of Hymettus, and touches the citadel’s
            red bulk with unearthly brightness; a soul when the day falls to sleep in the arms of
            night as Helios sinks over the western hill by Daphni. Then the Rock seems to throb and
            burn with life again. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is so bare that the hungry goats can hardly crop one spear of grass along its
            jagged slopes. It is so steep it scarce needs defence against an army. It is so
            commanding that he who stands on the westmost pinnacle can look across the windy hill of
            the Pnyx, across the brown plain-land and down to the sparkling blue sea with the busy
            havens of Peiræus and Phalerum, the scattered gray isles of the Ægean, and far away to
            the domelike crest of Acro-Corinthus. Let him turn to the right: below him nestles the
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gnarled hill of Areopagus, home of the Furies, the
            buzzing plaza of the Agora, the closely clustered city. Behind, there spread mountain,
            valley, plain,—here green, here brown, here golden,—with Pentelicus the Mighty rearing
            behind all, his summits fretted white, not with winter snows, but with lustrous marble.
            Look to the left: across the view passes the shaggy ridge of Hymettus, arid and scarred,
            as if wrought by the Titans, home only of goats and bees, of nymphs and satyrs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That was almost the self-same vision in the dim past when the first savage clambered
            this <span class="tei tei-q">“Citadel of Cecrops”</span> and spoke, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is my dwelling-place.”</span> This will be
            the vision until earth and ocean are no more. The human habitation changes, the temples
            rise and crumble; the red and gray rock, the crystalline air, the sapphire sea, come
            from the god, and these remain. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon and Hermione were come together to offer thanks to Athena for the glory of the
            Isthmus. The athlete had already mounted the citadel heading a myrtle-crowned procession
            to bear a formal thanksgiving, but his wife had not then been with him. Now they would
            go together, without pomp. They walked side by side. Nimble Chloë tripped behind with
            her mistress’s parasol. Old Manes bore the bloodless sacrifice, but Hermione said in her
            heart there came two too many. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Many a friendly eye, many a friendly word, followed as they crossed the Agora, where
            traffic was in its morning bustle. Glaucon answered every greeting with his winsome
            smile. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“All Athens seems our friend!”</span> he said, as close by the Tyrannicides’ statues at
            the upper end of the plaza a grave councilman bowed and an old bread woman left her
            stall to bob a courtesy. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">makaira</span></span>, dearest and best,”</span> he answered, looking not on
            the glorious citadel but on her face, <span class="tei tei-q">“could I have won the parsley wreath had there
              been no better wreath awaiting me at Eleusis? And to-day I am gladdest of the glad.
              For the gods have sent me blessings beyond desert, I no longer fear their envy as
              once. I enjoy honour with all good men. I have no enemy in the world. I have the
              dearest of friends, Cimon, Themistocles—beyond all, Democrates. I am blessed in love
              beyond Peleus espoused to Thetis, or Anchises beloved of Aphrodite, for my golden
              Aphrodite lives not on Olympus, nor Paphos, nor comes on her doves from Cythera, but
              dwells—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace.”</span> The hand laid on his mouth was small but firm. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not anger the goddess
              by likening me unto her. It is joy enough for me if I can look up at the sun and say,
                <span class="tei tei-q">‘I keep the love of Glaucon the Fortunate and the Good.’</span> ”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Walking thus in their golden dream, the two crossed the Agora, turned to the left from
            the Pnyx, and by crooked lanes went past the craggy rock of Areopagus, till before them
            rose a wooden palisade and a gate. Through this a steep path led upward to the citadel.
            Not to the Acropolis of fame. The buildings then upon the Rock in one short year would
            lie in heaps of fire-scarred ruin. Yet in that hour before Glaucon and Hermione a not
            unworthy temple rose, the old <span class="tei tei-q">“House of Athena,”</span> prototype of the later Parthenon.
            In the morning light it stood in beauty—a hundred Doric columns, a sculptured pediment,
            flashing with white marble and with tints of scarlet, blue, and gold. Below it, over the
            irregular plateau of the Rock, spread avenues of votive statues of gods and heroes in
            stone, bronze, or painted wood. Here <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and there were
            numerous shrines and small temples, and a giant altar for burning a hundred oxen. So
            hand in hand the twain went to the bronze portal of the Temple. The kindly old priest on
            guard smiled as he sprinkled them with the purifying salt water out of the brazen laver.
            The door closed behind them. For a moment they seemed to stand in the high temple in
            utter darkness. Then far above through the marble roof a softened light came creeping
            toward them. As from unfolding mist, the great calm face of the ancient goddess looked
            down with its unchanging smile. A red coal glowed on the tripod at her feet. Glaucon
            shook incense over the brazier. While it smoked, Hermione laid the crown of lilies
            between the knees of the half-seen image, then her husband lifted his hands and prayed
            aloud. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Athena, Virgin, Queen, Deviser of Wisdom,—whatever be the name thou lovest
              best,—accept this offering and hear. Bless now us both. Give us to strive for the
              noblest, to speak the wise word, to love one another. Give us prosperity, but not unto
              pride. Bless all our friends; but if we have enemies, be thou their enemy also. And so
              shall we praise thee forever.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This was all the prayer and worship. A little more meditation, then husband and wife
            went forth from the sacred cella. The panorama—rocks, plain, sea, and bending
            heavens—opened before them in glory. The light faded upon the purple breasts of the
            western mountains. Behind the Acropolis, Lycabettus’s pyramid glowed like a furnace. The
            marble on distant Pentelicus shone dazzlingly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon stood on the easternmost pinnacle of the Rock, watching the landscape. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Joy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">makaira</span></span>, joy,”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“we possess one another. We

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As they went down the steep, Cimon and Democrates came running to join them, and in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a merry party such as often went down to the havens of Athens in the springtime
            and summer: a dozen gentlemen, old and young, for the most part married, and followed
            demurely by their wives with the latter’s maids, and many a stout Thracian slave tugging
            hampers of meat and drink. Laughter there was, admixed with wiser talk; friends walking
            by twos and threes, with Themistocles, as always, seeming to mingle with all and to
            surpass every one both in jests and in wisdom. So they fared down across the broad
            plain-land to the harbours, till the hill Munychia rose steep before them. A scramble
            over a rocky, ill-marked way led to the top; then before them broke a second view
            comparable almost to that from the Rock of Athena: at their feet lay the four blue
            havens of Athens, to the right Phaleron, closer at hand the land-locked bay of Munychia,
            beyond that Zea, beyond that still a broader sheet—Peiræus, the new war-harbour of
            Athens. They could look down on the brown roofs of the port-town, the forest of masts,
            the merchantman unloading lumber from the Euxine, the merchantman loading dried figs for
            Syria; but most of all on the numbers of long black hulls, some motionless on the placid
            harbour, some propped harmlessly on the shore. Hermione clouded as she saw them, and
            glanced away. </p>

            pleasantry. Cimon interrupted them. Some of the party had caught a sun-burned shepherd
            in among the rocks, a veritable Pan in his shaggy goat-skin. The bribe of two obols
            brought him out with his pipe. Four of the slave-boys fell to dancing. The party sat
            down upon the burnt grass,—eating, drinking, wreathing poppy-crowns, and watching the
            nimble slaves and the ships that crawled like ants in the haven and bay below. Thus
            passed the noon, and as the sun dropped toward craggy Salamis across the strait, the men
            of the party wandered down to the ports and found boats to take them out upon the bay. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The wind was a zephyr. The water spread blue and glassy. The sun was sinking as a ball
            of infinite light. Themistocles, Democrates, and Glaucon were in one skiff, the athlete
            at the oars. They glided past the scores of black triremes swinging lazily at anchor.
            Twice they pulled around the proudest of the fleet,—the <a name="corr090" id="corr090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr"><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span></span>, the gift of Hermippus to the state, a princely gift even in days when
            every Athenian put his all at the public service. She would be Themistocles’s flag-ship.
            The young men noted her fine lines, her heavy side timbers, the covered decks, an
            innovation in Athenian men-of-war, and Themistocles put a loving hand on the keen bronze

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To Salamis or clear to Crete,”</span> rejoined Glaucon, setting his strength upon the

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not gloomy but serious,”</span> said the young orator, with an attempt at lightness; <span class="tei tei-q">“I
              have been preparing my oration against the contractor I’ve indicted for embezzling the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Destroy the man!”</span> cried the rower. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“No excuses; the man who robs the city in days like these is worse than he who betrays

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I see you are a savage patriot, Glaucon,”</span> said Themistocles, <span class="tei tei-q">“despite your
              Adonis face. We are fairly upon the bay; our nearest eavesdroppers, yon fishermen, are
              a good five furlongs. Would you see something?”</span> Glaucon rested on the oars, while
            the statesman fumbled in his breast. He drew out a papyrus sheet, which he passed to the
            rower, he in turn to Democrates. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span>
          <a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Look well, then, for I think no Persian spies are here. A month long have I wrought
              on this bit of papyrus. All my wisdom flowed out of my pen when I spread the ink. In
              short here is the ordering of the ships of the allied Greeks when we meet Xerxes in
              battle. Leonidas and our other chiefs gave me the task when we met at Corinth. To-day
              it is complete. Read it, for it is precious. Xerxes would give twenty talents for this
              one leaf from Egypt.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The young men peered at the sheet curiously. The details and diagrams were few and
            easy to remember, the Athenian ships here, the Æginetan next, the Corinthian next, and
            so with the other allies. A few comments on the use of the light 
            <a name="corr092" id="corr092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">penteconters</span> behind the
            heavy triremes. A few more comments on Xerxes’s probable naval tactics. Only the
            knowledge that Themistocles never committed himself in speech or writing without
            exhausting every expedient told the young men of the supreme importance of the paper.
            After due inspection the statesman replaced it in his breast. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You two have seen this,”</span> he announced, seemingly proud of his handiwork; <span class="tei tei-q">“Leonidas shall see this, then Xerxes, and after that—”</span> he laughed, but not in
              jest—<span class="tei tei-q">“men will remember Themistocles, son of Neocles!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The three lapsed into silence for a moment. The skiff was well out upon the sea. The
            shadows of the hills of Salamis and of Ægelaos, the opposing mountain of Attica, were
            spreading over them. Around the islet of Psyttaleia in the strait the brown fisher-boats
            were gliding. Beyond the strait opened the blue hill-girdled bay of Eleusis, now turning
            to fire in the evening sun. Everything was peaceful, silent, beautiful. Again Glaucon
            rested on his oars and let his eyes wander. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They drifted many moments in silence. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the return Themistocles once more vowed he caught a glimpse of the skiff of the
            unknown foreigners, but Democrates called it mere phantasy. Hermione met them at the
            Peiræus, and the party wandered back through the gathering dusk to the city, where each
            little group went its way. Themistocles went to his own house, where he said he expected
            Sicinnus; Cimon and Democrates sought a tavern for an evening cup; Glaucon and Hermione
            hastened to their house in the Colonus suburb near the trickling Cephissus, where in the
            starlit night the tettix<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> in the black old olives by the stream made its monotonous music, where
            great fireflies gleamed, where Philomela the nightingale called, and the tall plane
            trees whispered softly to the pines. When Hermione fell asleep, she had forgotten about
            the coming of the Persian, and dreamed that Glaucon was Eros, she was Psyche, and that
            Zeus was giving her the wings of a butterfly and a crown of stars. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span>
          <a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates went home later. After the heady Pramnian at the tavern, he roved away with
            Cimon and others to serenade beneath the lattice of a lady—none too prudish—in the
            Ceramicus quarter. But the fair one was cruel that night, and her slaves repelled the
            minstrels with pails of hot water from an upper window. Democrates thereupon quitted the
            party. His head was very befogged, but he could not expel one idea from it—that
            Themistocles had revealed that day a priceless secret, that the statesman and Glaucon
            and he himself were the only men who shared it, and that it was believed that Glaucon
            had visited the Babylonish carpet-seller. Joined to this was an overpowering
            consciousness that Helen of Troy was not so lovely as Hermione of Eleusis. When he came
            to his lodgings, however, his wits cleared in a twinkling after he had read two letters.
            The first was short. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates fronted ruin. What profit later details from Socias of the capture of the
            merchantman? Unless three days before the coming festival of the Panathenæa the orator
            could find a large sum, he was forever undone. His sequestering of the ship-money would
            become public property. He would be tried for his life. Themistocles would turn against
            him. The jury would hardly wait for the evidence. He would drink the poisonous hemlock
            and his corpse be picked by the crows in the Barathrum,—an open pit, sole burial place
            for Athenian criminals. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> One thing was possible: to go to Glaucon, confess all, and beg the money. Glaucon was
            rich. He could have the amount from Conon and Hermippus for the asking. But Democrates
            knew Glaucon well enough to perceive that while the athlete might find the money, he
            would <a name="corr095" id="corr095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">be</span> horrified at the foul disclosure. He would save his old comrade from death, but
            their friendship would be ended. He would feel in duty bound to tell Themistocles enough
            to ruin Democrates’s political prospects for all time. An appeal to Glaucon was
            therefore dismissed, and the politician looked for more desperate remedies. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates enjoyed apartments on the street of the Tripods east of the Acropolis, a
            fashionable promenade of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Athens. He was regarded as a
            confirmed bachelor. If, therefore, two or three dark-eyed flute girls in Phaleron had
            helped him to part with a good many minæ, no one scolded too loudly; the thing had been
            done genteelly and without scandal. Democrates affected to be a collector of fine arms
            and armour. The ceiling of his living room was hung with white-plumed helmets, on the
            walls glittered brass greaves, handsomely embossed shields, inlaid Chalcidian scimitars,
            and bows tipped with gold. Under foot were expensive rugs. The orator’s artistic tastes
            were excellent. Even as he sat in the deeply pillowed arm-chair his eye lighted on a
            Nike,—a statuette of the precious Corinthian bronze, a treasure for which the dealer’s
            unpaid account lay still, alas! in the orator’s coffer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Democrates was not thinking so much of the unpaid bronze-smith as of divers
            weightier debts. On the evening in question he had ordered Bias, the sly Thracian, out
            of the room; with his own hands had barred the door and closed the lattice; then with
            stealthy step thrust back the scarlet wall tapestry to disclose a small door let into
            the plaster. A key made the door open into a cupboard, out of which Democrates drew a
            brass-bound box of no great size, which he carried gingerly to a table and opened with a
            complex key. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The contents of the box were curious, to a stranger enigmatic. Not money, nor jewels,
            but rolls of closely written papyri, and things which the orator studied more
            intently,—a number of hard bits of clay bearing the impressions of seals. As Democrates
            fingered these, his face might have betrayed a mingling of keen fear and keener
            satisfaction. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no such collection in all Hellas,—no, not in the world,”</span> ran his
            commentary; <span class="tei tei-q">“here is the signet of the Tagos of Thessaly, here of the Bœotarch of
              Thebes, here of the King of Argos. I was able to secure the seal of Leonidas while in

              easily I took it! And this—of less value perhaps to a man of the world—is of my
              beloved Glaucon. And here are twenty more. Then the papyri,”</span>—he unrolled them
            lovingly, one after another,—<span class="tei tei-q">“precious specimens, are they not? Ah, by Zeus, I must
              be a very merciful and pious man, or I’d have used that dreadful power heaven has
              given me and never have drifted into these straits.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What that <span class="tei tei-q">“power”</span> was with which Democrates felt himself endued he did not even
            whisper to himself. His mood changed suddenly. He closed the box with a snap and locked
            it hurriedly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Cursed casket!—I think I would be happier if Phorcys, the old man of the deep, could

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He thrust the box back in the cupboard, drew forth a second like it, unlocked it, and
            took out more writings. Selecting two, he spread ink and papyrus before him, and copied
            with feverish haste. Once he hesitated, and almost flung back the writings into the
            casket. Once he glanced at the notes he had prepared for his speech against the
            defrauding contractor. He grimaced bitterly. Then the hesitation ended. He finished the
            copying, replaced the second box, and barred and concealed the cupboard. He hid his new
            copies in his breast and called in Bias. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He went down into the dimly lighted street and wound through the maze of back alleys
            wherein Athens abounded, but Democrates never missed his way. Once he caught the glint
            of a lantern—a slave lighting home his master from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dinner. The orator drew into a doorway; the others glided by, seeing nothing. Only
            when he came opposite the house of the Cyprian he saw light spreading from the opposite
            doorway and knew he must pass under curious eyes. Phormio was entertaining friends very
            late. But Democrates took boldness for safety, strode across the illumined ring, and up
            to the Cyprian’s stairway. The buzz of conversation stopped a moment. <span class="tei tei-q">“Again
            Glaucon,”</span> he caught, but was not troubled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“After all,”</span> he reflected, <span class="tei tei-q">“if seen at all, there is no harm in such a
            mistake.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The room was again glittering in its Oriental magnificence. The Cyprian advanced to
            meet his visitor, smiling blandly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Welcome, dear Athenian. We have awaited you. We are ready to heal your calamity.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates turned away his face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You know it already! O Zeus, I am the most miserable man in all Hellas!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And wherefore miserable, good friend?”</span> The Cyprian half led, half compelled the
            visitor to a seat on the divan. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it such to be enrolled from this day among the
              benefactors of my most gracious lord and king?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t goad me!”</span> Democrates wrung his hands. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am desperate. Take these papyri,
              read, pay, then let me never see your face again.”</span> He flung the two rolls in the
            Prince’s lap and sat in abject misery. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The other unrolled the writings deliberately, read slowly, motioned to Hiram, who also
            read them with catlike scrutiny. During all this not a word was spoken. Democrates
            observed the beautiful mute emerge from an inner chamber and silently take station at
            his master’s side, following the papers also with wonderful, eager eyes. Only after a
            long interval the Prince spoke. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Well—you bring what purports to be private memoranda of Themistocles on the
              equipment and arraying of the Athenian fleet. Yet these are only copies.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Copies; the originals cannot stay in my possession. It were ruin to give them up.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince turned to Hiram. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And do you say, from what you know of these things, these memoranda are genuine?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Genuine. That is the scanty wisdom of the least of your Highness’s slaves.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Oriental bowed himself, then stood erect in a manner that reminded Democrates of
            some serpent that had just coiled and uncoiled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Good,”</span> continued the emissary; <span class="tei tei-q">“yet I must ask our good Athenian to confirm them
              with an oath.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The orator groaned. He had not expected this last humiliation; but being forced to
            drink the cup, he drained it to the lees. He swore by Zeus Orchios, Watcher of Oaths,
            and Dike, the Eternal Justice, that he brought true copies, and that if he was perjured,
            he called a curse upon himself and all his line. The Cyprian received his oath with calm
            satisfaction, then held out the half of a silver shekel broken in the middle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Show this to Mydon, the Sicyonian banker at Phaleron. He holds its counterpart. He
              will pay the man who completes the coin ten talents.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates received the token, but felt that he must stand upon his dignity. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I have given an oath, stranger, but give the like to me. What proof have I of this
              Mydon?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The question seemed to rouse the unseen lion in the Cyprian. His eye kindled. His
            voice swelled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We leave oaths, Hellene, to men of trade and barter, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to men of trickery and guile. The Aryan noble is taught three things: to fear the
              king, to bend the bow, to speak the truth. And he learns all well. I have spoken,—my
              word is my oath.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Athenian shrank at the storm he had roused. But the Prince almost instantly curbed
            himself. His voice sank again to its easy tone of conciliation. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“So much for my word, good friend; yet better than an oath, look here. Can the man who

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He extended his right hand. On the second finger was a huge beryl signet. Democrates
            bent over it. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Two seated Sphynxes and a winged cherub flying above,—the seal of the royal

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince raised a warning finger. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hush, Athenian. Think what you will, but do not
              name me, though soon my name shall fly through all the world.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“So be it,”</span> rejoined Democrates, his hands clutching the broken coin as at a last
            reprieve from death. <span class="tei tei-q">“But be warned, even though I bear you no good-will. Themistocles
              is suspicious. Sicinnus his agent, a sly cat, is searching for you. The other day
              Themistocles, in the boat at Peiræus, was fain to have you questioned. If detected, I
              cannot save you.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince shrugged his shoulders. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Good Democrates, I come of a race that trusts in the omnipotence of God and does the
              right. Duty requires me in Athens. What Ahura-Mazda and Mithra his glorious vicegerent
              will, that shall befall me, be I in Hellas or in safe Ecbatana. The decree of the Most
              High, written among the stars, is good. I do not shun it.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The words were spoken candidly, reverently. Democrates <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>drew toward the door, and the others did not strive to detain him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“As you will,”</span> spoke the Athenian; <span class="tei tei-q">“I have warned you. Trust then your God. I
              have sold myself this once, but do not call me friend. Necessity is a sharp goad. May
              our paths never cross again!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Until you again have need,”</span> said the Prince, not seeking to wring from the other
            any promise. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates muttered a sullen farewell and went down the dark stairs. The light in
            Phormio’s house was <a name="corr101" id="corr101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">out.</span> No one seemed to be watching. On the
            way homeward Democrates comforted himself with the reflection that although the
            memoranda he sold were genuine, Themistocles often changed his plans, and he could see
            to it this scheme for arraying the war fleet was speedily altered. No real harm then
            would come to Hellas. And in his hand was the broken shekel,—the talisman to save him
            from destruction. Only when Democrates thought of Glaucon and Hermione he was fain to
            grit his teeth, while many times it returned to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“They think it was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glaucon</span></span> who has been twice now to visit the Babylonish
              carpet-seller.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As the door had closed behind the orator, the Prince had strode across the rugs to the
            window—and spat forth furiously as in extreme disgust. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fool, knave, villain! I foul my lips by speaking to his accursed ears!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The tongue in which he uttered this was the purest <span class="tei tei-q">“Royal Persian,”</span> such as one
            might hear in the king’s court. The beautiful <span class="tei tei-q">“mute,”</span> mute no longer, glided across
            the chamber and laid both hands upon his shoulder with a gracious caress. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And yet you bear with these treacherous creatures, you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>speak them fair?”</span> was the remark in the same musical tongue. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, because there is sore need. Because, with all their faithlessness, covetousness,
              and guile, these Hellenes are the keenest, subtlest race beneath Mithra’s glorious
              light. And we Persians must play with them, master them, and use them to make us lords
              of all the world.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hiram had disappeared behind a curtain. The Prince lifted her silver embroidered red
            cap. Over the graceful shoulders fell a mass of clear gold hair, so golden one might
            have hidden shining darics within it. The shining head pressed against the Persian’s
            breast. In this attitude, with the loose dress parting to show the tender lines, there
            could be no doubt of the other’s sex. The Prince laid his hand upon her neck and drew
            her bright face nearer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is a mad adventure on which we two have come,”</span> he spoke; <span class="tei tei-q">“how nearly you
              were betrayed at the Isthmus, when the Athenian saved you! A blunder by Hiram, an
              ill-turn of Fate, will ruin us yet. It is far, Rose of Eran, from Athens to the
              pleasant groves of Susa and the sparkling Choaspes.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“But the adventure is ending,”</span> answered she, with smiling confidence; <span class="tei tei-q">“Mazda has

            sculptures of the great temple on the Acropolis stood out in minute tracery They could
            see all the caverns and jagged ledges on the massy Rock. The flat roofs of the sleeping
            city lay like a dark and peaceful ocean. The mountains spread around in shadow-wrapped
            hush. Far away the dark stretch of the sea sent back a silver shimmering in answer to
            the moon. A landscape only possible at Athens! The two sensitive Orientals’ souls were
            deeply touched. For long they were silent, then the husband spoke. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates surpassed himself when arraigning the knavish contractor. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nestor and
              Odysseus both speak to us,”</span> shouted Polus in glee, flinging his black bean in the
            urn. <span class="tei tei-q">“What eloquence, what righteous fury when he painted the man’s infamy to pillage
              the city in a crisis like this!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So the criminal was sent to death and Democrates was showered with congratulations.
            Only one person seemed hardly satisfied with all the young orator did,—Themistocles.
            The latter told his lieutenant candidly he feared all was not being done to apprehend
            the Persian emissary. Themistocles even took it upon himself to send Sicinnus to run
            down several suspects, and just on the morning of the day preceding the Panathenæa—the
            great summer festival—Democrates received a hint which sent him home very thoughtful.
            He had met his chief in the Agora as he was leaving the Government-House, and
            Themistocles had again asked if he had smelt aught of the Persian agent. He had not. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles caught sight of one of the archons and hastened across the Agora to have
            a word with him. Democrates passed his hand across his forehead, beaded with sudden
            sweat-drops. He knew—though Themistocles had said not a word—that his superior was
            beginning to distrust his efforts, and that Sicinnus was working independently.
            Democrates had great respect for the acuteness of that Asiatic. He was coming perilously
            near the truth already. If the Cyprian and Hiram were arrested, the latter at least
            would surely try to save his life by betraying their nocturnal visitor. To get the spy
            safely out of Athens would be the first step,—but not all. Sicinnus once upon the scent
            would not readily drop it until he had discovered the emissary’s confederate. And of the
            fate of that confederate Themistocles had just given a grim hint. There was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one other solution possible. If Democrates could discover the
            confederate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">himself</span></span>, Sicinnus would regard the matter as cleared
            up and drop all interest therein. All these possibilities raced through the orator’s
            head, as does the past through one drowning. A sudden greeting startled him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A fair morning, Democrates.”</span> It was Glaucon. He walked arm-in-arm with Cimon. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The friends went their ways. Democrates hardly saw or heard anything until he was in
            his own chambers. Three <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>things were graven on his mind:
            Sicinnus was watching, the Babylonian was suspected, Glaucon was implicated and was
            sending a letter to Argos. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Bias the Thracian was discovered that afternoon by his master lurking in a corner of
            the chamber. Democrates seized a heavy dog-whip, lashed the boy unmercifully, then cast
            him out, threatening that eavesdropping would be rewarded by <span class="tei tei-q">“cutting into shoe
            soles.”</span> Then the master resumed his feverish pacings and the nervous twisting of his
            fingers. Unfortunately, Bias felt certain the threat would never have been uttered
            unless the weightiest of matters had been on foot. As in all Greek dwellings,
            Democrates’s rooms were divided not by doors but by hanging curtains, and Bias, letting
            curiosity master fear, ensconced himself again behind one of these and saw all his
            master’s doings. What Democrates said and did, however, puzzled his good servant quite
            sufficiently. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates had opened the privy cupboard, taken out one of the caskets and scattered
            its contents upon the table, then selected a papyrus, and seemed copying the writing
            thereon with extreme care. Next one of the clay seals came into play. Democrates was
            testing it upon wax. Then the orator rose, dashed the wax upon the floor, put his sandal
            thereon, tore the papyrus on which he wrote to bits. Again he paced restlessly, his
            hands clutching his hair, his forehead frowns and blackness, while Bias thought he heard
            him muttering as he walked:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O Zeus! O Apollo! O Athena! I cannot do this thing! Deliver me! Deliver!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then back to the table again, once more to pick up the mysterious clay, again to copy,
            to stamp on the wax, to fling down, mutilate, and destroy. The pantomime was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gone through three times. Bias could make nothing of it. Since
            the day his parents—following the barbarous Thracian custom—had sold him into slavery
            and he had passed into Democrates’s service, the lad had never seen his master acting
            thus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Clearly the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrios</span></span> is mad,”</span> was his own explanation, and
            growing frightened at following the strange movements of his lord, he crept from his
            retreat and tried to banish uncanny fears at a safe distance, by tying a thread to the
            leg of a gold-chafer<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> and
            watching its vain efforts at flight. Yet had he continued his eavesdropping he might
            have found—if not the key to all Democrates’s doings—at least a partial explanation.
            For the fourth time the papyrus had been written, for the fourth time the orator had
            torn it up. Then his eyes went down to the lump of clay before him on the table. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Curses upon the miserable stuff!”</span> he swore almost loudly; <span class="tei tei-q">“it is this which has
              set the evil thoughts to racing. Destroy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>, and the deed is
              beyond my power.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He held up the clay and eyed it as a miser might his gold. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“What a little lump! Not very hard. I can dash it on the floor and it dissolves in

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He picked at it with his finger and broke a small piece from the edge. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A little more, the stamp is ruined. I could not use it. Better if it were ruined. And

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He laid the clay upon the table and sat watching it wistfully. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O Father Zeus!”</span> he broke out after silence, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I were not compelled by fear!
              Sicinnus is so sharp, Themistocles <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so unmerciful! It
              would be a terrible death to die,—and every man is justified in shunning death.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He looked at the inanimate lump as if he expected it to answer him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, I am all alone. No one to counsel me. In every other trouble when has it been as
              this? Glaucon? Cimon? Themistocles?—What would they advise?”</span>—he ended with a
            laugh more bitter than a sob. <span class="tei tei-q">“And I must save myself, but at such a price!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He pressed his hands over his eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Curses on the hour I met Lycon! Curses on the Cyprian and his gold! It would have

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But as he said it, he arose, took the charmed bit of clay, replaced in the box, and
            locked the coffer. His hand trembled as he did it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot do this thing. I have been foolish, wicked,—but I must not be driven mad by
              fear. The Cyprian must quit Athens to-morrow. I can throw Sicinnus off the scent. I
              shall never be the worse.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He walked with the box toward the cupboard, but stopped halfway. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a dreadful death to die;”</span>—his thoughts raced and were half uttered,—<span class="tei tei-q">“hemlock!—men grow cold limb by limb and keep all their faculties to the end. And the

              life?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Instead of going to the cupboard he approached the window. The sun beat hotly, but as
            he leaned forth into the street he shivered as on a winter’s morn. In blank wretch<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>edness he watched the throng beneath the window,
            pannier-laden asses, venders of hot sausage with their charcoal stoves and trays, youths
            going to and from the gymnasium, slaves returning from market. How long he stood thus,
            wretched, helpless, he did not know. At last he stirred himself. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot stand gaping like a fool forever. An omen, by every god an omen! Ah! what am
              I to do?”</span> He glanced toward the sky in vain hope of a lucky raven or eagle winging
            out of the east, but saw only blue and brightness. Then his eye went down the street,
            and at the glance the warm blood tingled from his forehead to his heels. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She was passing,—Hermione, child of Hermippus. She walked before, two comely maids
            went after with her stool and parasol; but they were the peonies beside the rose. She
            had thrown her blue veil back. The sun played over the sheen of her hair. As she moved,
            her floating saffron dress of the rare muslin of Amorgos now revealed her delicate form,
            now clothed her in an enchanting cloud. She held her head high, as if proud of her own
            grace and of the beauty and fair name of her husband. She never looked upward, nor
            beheld how Democrates’s eyes grew like bright coals as he gazed on her. He saw her clear
            high forehead, he heard—or thought he heard despite the jar of the street—the rustle
            of the muslin robe. Hermione passed, nor ever knew how, by taking this way from the
            house of a friend, she coloured the skein of life for three mortals—for herself, her
            husband, and Democrates. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates followed her with his eyes until she vanished around the fountain at the
            street corner; then sprang back from the window. The workings of his face were terrible.
            It was an instant when men grasp the godlike or sink to the demon, when they do deeds
            never to be recalled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The omen!”</span> he almost cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“the omen!

              not his, whose then but mine? I will do the deed to the uttermost. The god is with
            me.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He flung the casket upon the table and spread its fateful contents again before him.
            His hand flew over the papyrus with marvellous speed and skill. He knew that all his
            faculties were at his full command and unwontedly acute. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Bias was surprised at his sport by a sudden clapping of his master’s hands. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What is it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>?”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Go to Agis. He keeps the gaming-house in the Ceramicus. You know where. Tell him to

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He flung at the boy a coin. Bias opened eyes and mouth in wonder. It was not silver,
            but a golden daric. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t blink at it, sheep, but run. Bring Agis,”</span> ordered the master,—and Bias’s
            legs never went faster than on that afternoon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Agis came. Democrates knew his man and had no difficulty in finding his price. They
            remained talking together till it was dark, yet in so guarded a tone that Bias, though
            he listened closely, was unable to make out anything. When Agis went away, he carried
            two letters. One of these he guarded as if holding the crown jewels of the Great King;
            the second he despatched by a discreet myrmidon to the rooms of the Cyprian in Alopece.
            Its contents were pertinent and ran thus:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Democrates to the stranger calling himself a prince of Cyprus, greeting:—Know

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After Agis was gone the old trembling came again to Democrates. He had Bias light all
            the lamps. The room seemed full of lurking goblins,—harpies, gorgons, the Hydra, the
            Minotaur, every other foul and noxious shape was waiting to spring forth. And, most
            maddening of all, the chorus of Æschylus, that Song of the Furies Democrates had heard
            recited at the Isthmus, rang in the miserable man’s ears:— </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates approached the bust of Hermes standing in one corner. The brazen face
            seemed to wear a smile of malignant gladness at the fulfilment of his will. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hermes,”</span> prayed the orator, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hermes Dolios, god of craft and lies, thieves’ god,

              me in the deed to which I set my hand,”</span>—he hesitated, he dared not bribe the
            shrewd god with too mean a gift, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I vow to set in thy temple at Tanagra three tall
              tripods of pure gold. So be with me on the morrow, and I will not forget thy

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The brazen face still smiled on; the room was very still. Yet Democrates took comfort.
            Hermes was a great god and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would help him. When the
            song of the Furies grew too loud, Democrates silenced it by summoning back Hermione’s
            face and asking one triumphant question:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            when one crossed the Agora. Beneath the sheltering porticos lurked bright-faced girls
            who pelted each passer with violets, narcissus, and hyacinths. For this was the morn of
            the final crowning day of the Panathenæa, greatest, gladdest of Athenian festivals. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Athletic contests had preceded it and stately Pyrrhic dances of men in full armour.
            There had been feasting and merry-making despite the darkening shadow of the Persian.
            Athens seemed awakened only to rejoice. To-day was the procession to the Acropolis, the
            bearing of the sacred robe to Athena, the public sacrifice for all the people. Not even
            the peril of Xerxes could hinder a gladsome holiday. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sun had just risen above Hymettus, the Agora shops were closed, but the plaza
            itself and the lesches—the numerous little club houses about it—overran with
            gossipers. On the stone bench before one of these buzzed the select coterie that of wont
            assembled in Clearchus’s booth; only Polus the juror now and then nodded and snored. He
            had sat up all night hearing the priestesses chant their ceaseless litanies on the
            Acropolis. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Our good friend surely thinks so!”</span> rejoined the potter, dryly; <span class="tei tei-q">“but since he
              won’t trust us with his precious secret, I think it much more interesting to watch the

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The statesman cantered past on a shining white Thessalian. At his heels were prancing
            Cimon, Democrates, Glau<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>con, and many another youth of
            the noble houses of Athens. At sight of the son of Conon, Polus had wagged his head in a
            manner utterly perplexing to his associates, and they were again perplexed when they saw
            Democrates wheel back from the side of his chief and run up for a hurried word with a
            man in the crowd they recognized as Agis. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Agis is a strange fish to have dealings with a <span class="tei tei-q">‘steward’</span> of the procession

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You’ll be enlightened to-morrow,”</span> said Polus, exasperatingly. Then as the band of

            on the glancing eyes, on the moving lines of colour? Not the artist,—his pencil may not

            sweeping in bright array across the welcoming city. Nor can the sculptor’s marble shape
            the marching forms, the rippling draperies, the warm and buoyant life. The life of
            Athens was the crown of Greece. The festival of the Panathenæa was the crown of Athens. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Never had Helios looked down on fairer landscape or city. The doors of the patrician
            houses were opened; for a day unguarded, unconstrained, the daughters, wives, and
            mothers of the nobility of Athens walked forth in their queenly beauty. One could see
            that the sculptor’s master works were but rigid counterparts of lovelier flesh and
            blood. One could see veterans, stalwart almost as on the day of the old-time battles,
            but crowned with the snow of years. One could see youths, and need no longer marvel the
            young Apollo was accounted fair. Flowers, fluttering mantles, purple, gold, the bravery
            of armour, rousing music—what was missing? All conjoined to make a perfect spectacle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sun had chased the last vapours from the sky. The little ravines on distant
            Hymettus stood forth sharply as though near at hand. The sun grew hot, but men and women
            walked with bared heads, and few were the untanned cheeks and shoulders. Children of the
            South, and lovers of the Sun-King, the Athenians sought no shelter, their own bright
            humour rejoicing in the light. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the broad parade ground outside the Dipylon, the towering northwestern gate, the
            procession gathered. Themistocles the Handsome, never more gallant than now upon the
            white Thessalian, was ordering the array, the ten young men, <span class="tei tei-q">“stewards of the
              Panathenæa,”</span> assisting. He sent his last glance down the long files, his ivory wand
            signed to the musicians in the van. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles led. Under the massy double gate caracoled the charger. The robe of his
            rider blew out behind him like purple wings. There was the cry and clang of cymbals and
            drums. From the gray battlement yellow daisies rained down like gold. Cantering,
            halting, advancing, beckoning, the chief went forward, and behind swept the <span class="tei tei-q">“knights,”</span> the mounted chivalry of Athens,—three hundred of the noblest youths of
            Attica, on beasts sleek and spirited, and in burnished armour, but about every helm a
            wreath. Behind the <span class="tei tei-q">“knights”</span> rode the magistracy, men white-headed and grave, some
            riding, some in flower-decked cars. After these the victors in the games and contests of
            the preceding day. Next the elders of Athens—men of blameless life, beautiful in hale
            and honoured age. Next the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ephebi</span></span>,—the youths close to manhood,
            whose fair limbs glistened under their sweeping chitons. Behind them, their sisters,
            unveiled, the maidens of Athens, walking in rhythmic beauty, and with them their
            attendants, daughters of resident foreigners. Following upon these was the long line of
            bleating victims, black bulls with gilded horns and ribbon-decked rams without blemish.
            And next—but here the people leaned from parapet, house-roof, portico, and shouted
            louder than ever: </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The car and the robe of Athena! Hail, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Io, pæan!</span></span> hail!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Up the street on a car shaped like a galley moved the peplus, the great robe of the
            sovran goddess. From afar one could see the wide folds spread on a shipyard and rippling
            in the breeze. But what a sail! One year long had the noblest women of Attica wrought on
            it, and all the love and art that might breathe through a needle did not fail. It was a
            sheen of glowing colour. The strife of Athena with the brutish giants, her contest with
            Arachne, the deeds of the heroes of Athens—Erechtheus, Theseus, Codrus: these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were some of the pictures. The car moved noiselessly on
            wheels turned by concealed mechanism. Under the shadow of the sail walked the fairest of
            its makers, eight women, maids and young matrons, clothed in white mantles and wreaths,
            going with stately tread, unmoved by the shouting as though themselves divine. Seven
            walked together. But one, their leader, went before,—Hermione, child of Hermippus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Many an onlooker remembered this sight of her, the deep spiritual eyes, the symmetry
            of form and fold, the perfect carriage. Fair wishes flew out to her like doves. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“May she be blessed forever! May King Helios forever bring her joy!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Some cried thus. More thought thus. All seemed more glad for beholding her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Behind the peplus in less careful array went thousands of citizens of every age and
            station, all in festival dress, all crowned with flowers. They followed the car up the
            Dromos Street, across the cheering Agora, and around the southern side of the Acropolis,
            making a full circuit of the citadel. Those who watched saw Glaucon with Democrates and
            Cimon give their horses to slaves, and mount the bare knoll of Areopagus, looking down
            upon the western face of the Acropolis. As the procession swung about to mount the
            steep, Hermione lifted her glance to Areopagus, saw her husband gazing down on her,
            raised her hands in delighted gesture, and he answered her. It was done in the sight of
            thousands, and the thousands smiled with the twain. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Justice! The beautiful salutes the beautiful.”</span> And who thought the less of
            Hermione for betraying the woman beneath the mien of the goddess? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But now the march drew to an end. The procession halted, reformed, commenced the
            rugged way upward. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Suddenly from the bastion of the
            Acropolis above wafted new music. Low, melancholy at first, as the pipers and harpers
            played in the dreamy Lydian mode, till, strengthening into the bolder Æolic, the strains
            floated down, inviting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come up hither,”</span> then stronger still it pealed in the
            imperious crash of the Doric as the procession mounted steadily. Now could be seen great
            Lamprus, Orpheus’s peer, the master musician, standing on the balcony above the gate,
            beating time for the loud choral. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A chorus amongst the marchers and a second chorus in the citadel joined together, till
            the red crags shook,—singing the old hymn of the Homeridæ to Athena, homely, rude, yet
            dear with the memory of ages:— </p>

          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Up the face of the Rock, up the long, statue-lined way, till through the gate the
            vision burst,—the innumerable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fanes and altars, the
            assembly of singers and priests, the great temple in its pride of glittering marble.
            Clearer, stronger sounded the choral, shot up through the limpid azure; swaying,
            burning, throbbing, sobs and shouting, tears and transports, so mounted new strains of
            the mighty chorus, lit through with the flames of Homeric verse. Then stronger yet was
            the mingling of voices, earth, sky, deep, beasts’ cry and gods’ cry, all voiced, as
            chorus answered to chorus. Now the peplus was wafted on a wave of song toward the
            temple’s dawn-facing portal, when from beneath the columns, as the tall valves turned
            and the sun leaped into the cella, hidden voices returned the former strains—mournful
            at first. Out of the adytum echoed a cry of anguish, the lament of the Mother of Wisdom
            at her children’s deathly ignorance, which plucks them down from the Mount of the
            Beautiful Vision. But as the thousands neared, as its pæans became a prayer, as yearning
            answered to yearning, lo! the hidden song swelled and soared,—for the goddess looked
            for her own, and her own were come to her. And thus in beneath the massy pediment, in
            through the wide-flung doors, floated the peplus, while under its guardian shadow walked
            Hermione. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So they brought the robe to Athena. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon and his companions had watched the procession ascend, then followed to see the
            sacrifice upon the giant altar. The King Archon cut the throat of the first ox and made
            public prayer for the people. Wood soaked in perfumed oil blazed upon the huge stone
            platform of the sacrifice. Girls flung frankincense upon the roaring flames. The music
            crashed louder. All Athens seemed mounting the citadel. The chief priestess came from
            the holy house, and in a brief hush proclaimed that the goddess had received the robe
            with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all favour. After her came the makers of the
            peplus, and Hermione rejoined her husband. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us not stay to the public feast,”</span> was her wish; <span class="tei tei-q">“let these hucksters and
              charcoal-burners who live on beans and porridge scramble for a bit of burned meat, but
              we return to Colonus.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Good then,”</span> answered Glaucon, <span class="tei tei-q">“and these friends of course go with us.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cimon assented readily. Democrates hesitated, and while hesitating was seized by the
            cloak by none other than Agis, who gave a hasty whisper and vanished in the swirling
            multitude before Democrates could do more than nod. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He’s an uncanny fox,”</span> remarked Cimon, mystified; <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose you know his
              reputation?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The servant of Athens must sometimes himself employ strange servants,”</span> evaded the
            orator. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet you might suffer your friends to understand—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dear son of Miltiades,”</span> Democrates’s voice shook in the slightest, <span class="tei tei-q">“the meaning
              of my dealings with Agis I pray Athena you may never have cause to know.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Which means you will not tell us. Then by Zeus I swear the secret no doubt is not
              worth the knowing.”</span> Cimon stopped suddenly, as he saw a look of horror on
            Hermione’s face. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, lady! what’s the matter?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon,”</span> she groaned, <span class="tei tei-q">“frightful omen! I am terrified!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon’s hands dropped at her cry. He himself paled slightly. In one of his moods of
            abstraction he had taken the small knife from his belt and begun to pare his nails,—to
            do which after a sacrifice was reputed an infallible means of provoking heaven’s anger.
            The friends were grave and silent. The athlete gave a forced laugh. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span>
          <a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The goddess will be merciful to-day. To-morrow I will propitiate her with a goat.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, now, not to-morrow,”</span> urged Hermione, with white lips, but her husband
            refused. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The goddess is surfeited with sacrifices this morning. She would forget mine.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then he led the rest, elbowing the way through the increasing swarms of young and old,
            and down into the half-deserted city. Democrates left them in the Agora, professing
            great stress of duties. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Strange man,”</span> observed Cimon, as he walked away; <span class="tei tei-q">“what has he this past month
              upon his mind? That Persian spy, I warrant. But the morning wanes. It’s a long way to
              Colonus. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let us drink, for the sun is in the zenith.’</span> So says Alcæus—and I love
              the poet, for he like myself is always thirsty.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The three went on to the knoll of Colonus where Glaucon dwelt. Cimon was overrunning
            with puns and jests, but the others not very merry. The omen of Glaucon’s
            thoughtlessness, or something else, made husband and wife silent, yet it was a day when
            man or maid should have felt their spirits rise. The sky had never been brighter, not in
            Athens. Never had the mountains and sea spread more gloriously. From the warm
            olive-groves sounded the blithesome note of the Attic grasshopper. The wind sweeping
            over the dark cypresses by the house set their dark leaves to talking. The afternoon
            passed in pleasure, friends going and coming; there was laughter, music, and good
            stories. Hermione at least recovered part of her brightness, but her husband, contrary
            to all custom, remained taciturn, even melancholy. At last as the gentle tints of
            evening began to cover hill and plain and the red-tiled roofs of the ample city, all the
            friends were gone, saving only Cimon, and he—reckless fellow—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was well able to dispense with companionship, being, in the words of
            Theognis, <span class="tei tei-q">“not absolutely drunk, nor sober quite.”</span> Thus husband and wife found
            themselves alone together on the marble bench beneath the old cypress. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">makaire</span></span>! dearest and best,”</span> asked Hermione, her hands
            touching his face, <span class="tei tei-q">“is it the omen that makes you grow so sad? For the sun of your
              life is so seldom under clouds that when it is clouded at all, it seems as deep
              darkness.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He answered by pressing back her hair, <span class="tei tei-q">“No, not the omen. I am not a slave to chance
              like that. Yet to-day,—the wise God knows wherefore,—there comes a sense of brooding
              fear. I have been too happy—too blessed with friendship, triumph, love. It cannot
              last. Clotho the Spinner will weary of making my thread of gold and twine in a darker
              stuff. Everything lovely must pass. What said Glaucus to Diomedes? <span class="tei tei-q">‘Even as the race
                of leaves, so likewise are those of men; the leaves that now are, the wind
                scattereth, and the forest buddeth forth more again; thus also with the race of men,
                one putteth forth, another ceaseth.’</span> So even my joy must pass—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon,—take back the words. You frighten me.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He felt her in his arms trembling, and cursed himself for what he had uttered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A blight upon my tongue! I have frightened you, and without cause. Surely the day is
              bright enough, surely Athena having been thus far good we can trust her goodness
              still. Who knows but that it be many a year before our sun comes to his setting!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He kissed her many times. She grew comforted, but they had not been together long when
            they were surprised by the approach of Themistocles and Hermippus. Hermione ran to her
            father. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Themistocles and I were summoned hither,”</span> explained <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hermippus, <span class="tei tei-q">“by a message from Democrates bidding us come to Colonus at
              once, on an urgent matter touching the public weal.”</span>
          </p>

            Democrates. He dismounted with a bound, and as he did so the friends saw that his face
            was red as with pent-up excitement. Themistocles advanced hastily. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Seizing the snivelling Seuthes, the orator led into the house and to a private
            chamber. The rest followed, in blank wonderment. Cimon had recovered enough to
            follow—none too steadily. But when Hermione approached, Democrates motioned her back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I have warned you, lady. Do not blame me if you hear the worst,”</span> rejoined
            Democrates, barring the door. A single swinging lamp shed a fitful light on the
            scene—the whimpering prisoner, the others all amazed, the orator’s face, tense and
            white. Democrates’s voice seemed metallic as he continued:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, Seuthes, we must search you. Produce first the letter from Glaucon.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fat florid little Corinthian was dressed as a traveller, a gray chalmys to his
            hips, a brimmed brown hat, and high black boots. His hands were now untied. He tugged
            from his belt a bit of papyrus which Democrates handed to Themistocles, enjoining <span class="tei tei-q">“Open.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The weal of Athens outweighs even the pleasure of Glaucon,”</span> returned the orator,
            harshly, <span class="tei tei-q">“and you, Themistocles, note that Glaucon does not deny that the seal here is
              his own.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A courteous letter of thanks to Ageladas.”</span> The senior statesman was frowning. <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon is right. Either you are turned mad, or are victim of some prank,—is it

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am as innocent as a babe. I’d swear it by the Styx,”</span> responded that young man,

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I fear we are not at the end of the examination,”</span> observed Democrates, with
            ominous slowness. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, Seuthes, recollect your plight. Have you no other letter about
              you?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is possible,”</span> remarked his prosecutor, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are an innocent victim, or at
              least do not realize the intent of what you bear. I must examine the lining of your
              chalmys. Nothing. Your girdle. Nothing. Your hat, remove it. Quite empty. Blessed be
              Athena if my fears prove groundless. But my first duty is to Athens and Hellas. Ah!
              Your high boots. Remove the right one.”</span> The orator felt within, and shook the boot
            violently. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing again. The left one, empty it seems. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ei!</span></span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In a tense silence he shook from the boot a papyrus, rolled and sealed. It fell on the

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermippus, who had been following all the scene in silence, bent, lifted the fateful
            paper, and he too gave a cry of grief. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

              believe me, I can make good all I say. Since my return from the Isthmia, I have been
              observed to be sad. Rightly—for knowing Glaucon as I did, I grew suspicious, and I
              loved him. You have thought me not diligent in hunting down the Persian spy. You were
              wrong. But how could I ruin my friend without full proof? I made use of Agis,—no
              genteel confederate, to be sure, but honest, patriotic, indefatigable. I soon had my
              eyes on the suspected Babylonish carpet-seller. I observed Glaucon’s movements
              closely, they gave just ground for suspicion. The Babylonian, I came to feel, was none
              other than an agent of Xerxes himself. I discovered that Glaucon had been making this
              emissary nocturnal visits.”</span>

            a slave. The Thracian had a merry wit and a story-teller’s gift that more than paid for

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You’ll be ruined by too much charity,”</span> bewailed the woman, but Bias followed the
            fishmonger into the night. The moon shone down the narrow street, falling over the
            stranger who half lay, half squatted by the Hermes. When the two approached him, he
            tried to stagger to his feet, then reeled, and Phormio’s strong arms seized him. The man
            resisted feebly, and seemed never to hear the fishmonger’s friendly questions. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not hear? I am innocent. I never visited the Persian spy. I never betrayed the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Phormio was a man to recover from surprise quickly, and act swiftly and to the
            purpose. He made haste to lead his unfortunate visitor inside and lay him on his one
            hard couch. Scarcely was this done, however, when Lampaxo ran up to Glaucon in mingled

            himself higher—strength and mind in a measure returned. Bias had whispered to Phormio
            rapidly. Perhaps he had guessed more of his master’s doings than he had dared to hint
            before. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hark you, Master Glaucon,”</span> began Phormio, not unkindly. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are with friends,

            last. He sat silent while Phormio clutched his own head. Then Glaucon darted around wild

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Quick strides took him to a chest. He dragged forth a sleeveless sailor’s cloak of

            rent chiton took an instant, another instant to
            clap on the fugitive’s head a brimless red cap. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euge!</span></span>—you grow transformed. But that white face of yours is
              dangerous. See!”</span> he rubbed over the Alcmæonid’s face two handfuls of black ashes
            snatched from the hearth and sprang back with a great laugh, <span class="tei tei-q">“you’re a sailor unlading
              charcoal now. Zeus himself would believe it. All is ready—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For prison?”</span> asked Glaucon, clearly understanding little. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For the sea, my lad. For Athens is no place for you to-morrow, and Brasidas sails at
              dawn. Some more wine? It’s a long, brisk walk.”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“To the havens? You trust me? You doubt the accusation which every friend save
              Hermione believes? O pure Athena—and this is possible!”</span> Again Glaucon’s head
            whirled. It took more of the fiery wine to stay him up. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ay, boy,”</span> comforted Phormio, very gruff, <span class="tei tei-q">“you shall walk again around Athens
              with a bold, brave face, though not to-morrow, I fear. Polus trusts his heart and not
              his head in voting <span class="tei tei-q">‘guilty,’</span> so I trust it voting <span class="tei tei-q">‘innocent.’</span> ”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I warn you,”</span> Glaucon spoke rapidly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ve no claim on your friendship. If your
              part in this is discovered, you know our juries.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“That I know,”</span> laughed Phormio, grimly, <span class="tei tei-q">“for I know dear Polus. So now my own
              cloak and we are off.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Lampaxo, who had watched everything with accumulating anger, now burst loose. She
            bounded to the door. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Constables! Help! Athens is betrayed!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She bawled that much through the lattice before her husband and Bias dragged her back.
            Fortunately the street was empty. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“That I should see this! My own husband betraying the city! Aiding a traitor!”</span> Then
            she began whimpering through her nose. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mu! mu!</span></span> leave the
              villain to his fate. Think of me if not of your own safety. Woe! when was a woman more
              misused?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But here her lament ended, for Phormio, with the firmness of a man thoroughly
            determined, thrust a rag into her mouth and with Bias’s help bound her down upon the
            couch by means of a convenient fish-cord. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am grieved to stop your singing, blessed dear,”</span> spoke the fishmonger, indulging
            in a rare outburst of sarcasm against his formidable helpmeet, <span class="tei tei-q">“but we play a game
              with Fate to-night a little too even to allow unfair chances. Bias will watch you

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Thracian promised to do his part. His affection for Democrates was clearly not the
            warmest. Lampaxo’s farewell, as Phormio guided his half-dazed companion into the street,
            was a futile struggle and a choking. The ways were empty and silent. Glaucon allowed
            himself to be led by the hand and did not speak. He hardly knew how or whither Phormio
            was taking him. Their road lay along the southern side of the Acropolis, past the tall
            columns of the unfinished Temple of Zeus, which reared to giant height in the white
            moonlight. This, as well as the overshadowing Rock itself, they left behind without
            incident. Phormio chose devious alleys, and they met neither Scythian constables nor
            bands of roisterers. Only once the two passed a house bright with lamps. Jovial guests
            celebrated a late wedding feast. Clearly the two heard the marriage hymn of Sappho. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon stopped like one struck with an arrow. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“They sang that song the night I wedded Hermione. Oh, if I could drink the Lethe water

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> commanded Phormio, pulling upon his arm. <span class="tei tei-q">“The sun will shine again
              to-morrow.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus the twain went forward, Glaucon saying not a word. He hardly knew how they passed
            the Itonian Gate and crossed the long stretch of open country betwixt the city and its
            havens. No pursuit as yet—Glaucon was too perplexed to reason why. At last he knew they
            entered Phaleron. He heard the slapping waves, the creaking tackle, the shouting
            sailors. Torches gleamed ruddily. A mer<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chantman was
            loading her cargo of pottery crates and oil jars,—to sail with the morning breeze.
            Swarthy shipmen ran up and down the planks betwixt quay and ship, balancing their heavy
            jars on their heads as women bear water-pots. From the tavern by the mooring came
            harping and the clatter of cups, while two women—the worse for wine—ran out to drag
            the newcomers in to their revel. Phormio slapped the slatterns aside with his staff. In
            the same fearful waking dream Glaucon saw Phormio demanding the shipmaster. He saw
            Brasidas—a short man with the face of a hound and arms to hug like a bear—in converse
            with the fishmonger, saw the master at first refusing, then gradually giving reluctant
            assent to some demand. Next Phormio was half leading, half carrying the fugitive aboard
            the ship, guiding him through a labyrinth of bales, jars, and cordage, and pointing to a
            hatchway ladder, illumined by a swinging lantern. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Keep below till the ship sails; don’t wipe the charcoal from your face till clear of
              Attica. Officers will board the vessel before she puts off; yet have no alarm, they’ll
              only come to see she doesn’t violate the law against exporting grain.”</span> Phormio
            delivered his admonitions rapidly, at the same time fumbling in his belt. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here—here
              are ten drachmæ, all I’ve about me, but something for bread and figs till you make new
              friends,—in which there’ll be no trouble, I warrant. Have a brave heart. Remember
              that Helios can shine lustily even if you are not in Athens, and pray the gods to give
              a fair return.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon felt the money pressed within his palm. He saw Phormio turning away. He caught
            the fishmonger’s hard hand and kissed it twice. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I can never reward you. Not though I live ten thousand years and have all the gold of

            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phui!</span></span>”</span> answered Phormio, with a shrug; <span class="tei tei-q">“don’t detain me,
              it’s time I was home and was unlashing my loving wife.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with that he was gone. Glaucon descended the ladder. The cabin was low, dark,
            unfurnished save with rude pallets of straw, but Glaucon heeded none of these things.
            Deeper than the accusation by Democrates, than the belief therein by Themistocles and
            the others, the friendship of the fishmonger touched him. A man base-born, ignorant,
            uncivil, had believed him, had risked his own life to save him, had given him money out
            of his poverty, had spoken words of fair counsel and cheer. On the deck above the
            sailors were tumbling the cargo, and singing at their toil, but Glaucon never heard
            them. Flinging himself on a straw pallet, for the first time came the comfort of hot
            tears. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Very early the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon’s</span></span> square mainsail caught the breeze from
            the warm southwest. The hill of Munychia and the ports receded. The panorama of
            Athens—plain, city, citadel, gray Hymettus, white Pentelicus—spread in a vista of
            surpassing beauty—so at least to the eyes of the outlaw when he clambered to the poop.
            As the ship ran down the low coast, land and sea seemed clothed with a robe of
            rainbow-woven light. Far, near,—islands, mountains, and deep were burning with saffron,
            violet, and rose, as the Sun-God’s car climbed higher above the burning path it marked
            across the sea. Glaucon saw all in clear relief,—the Acropolis temple where he had
            prayed, the Pnyx and Areopagus, the green band of the olive groves, even the knoll of
            Colonus,—where he had left his all. Never had he loved Athens more than now. Never had
            she seemed fairer to his eyes than now. He was a Greek, and to a Greek death was only by
            one stage a greater ill than exile. </p>

            seaworthy. The foresail blew in tatters. The closely brailed mainsail shook the weakened
            mast. The sailors had dropped their quaint oaths, and began to pray—sure proof of
            danger. The dozen passengers seemed almost too panic-stricken to aid in flinging the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And wherefore?”</span> came the bitter answer; <span class="tei tei-q">“what is left me to fear? I desire no
              life hereafter. There can be no consciousness without sad memory.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are very young to speak thus.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“But not too young to have suffered.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A wave dashed one of the steering rudders out of the grip of the sailor guiding it.
            The rush of water swept him overboard. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span> lurched. The
            wind smote the straining mainsail, and the shivered mainmast tore from its stays and
            socket. Above the bawling of wind and water sounded the crash. The ship, with only a
            small sail upon the poop, blew about into the trough of the sea. A mountain of green
            water thundered over the prow, bearing away men and wreckage. The <span class="tei tei-q">“governor,”</span>
            Brasidas’s mate, flung away the last steering tiller. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span> is dying, men,”</span> he trumpeted through his hands.
              <span class="tei tei-q">“To the boat! Save who can!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The pinnace set in the waist was cleared away by frantic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hands and axes. Ominous rumblings from the hold told how the undergirding
            could not keep back the water. The pinnace was dragged to the ship’s lee and launched in
            the comparative calm of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon’s</span></span> broadside. Pitifully small
            was the boat for five and twenty. The sailors, desperate and selfish, leaped in first,
            and watched with jealous eyes the struggles of the passengers to follow. The noisy
            merchant slipped in the leap, and they heard him scream once as the wave swallowed him.
            Brasidas stood in the bow of the pinnace, clutching a sword to cut the last rope. The
            boat filled to the gunwales. The spray dashed into her. The sailors bailed with their
            caps. Another passenger leaped across, whereat the men yelled and drew their dirks. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Three are left. Room for one more. The rest must swim!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon stood on the poop. Was life still such a precious thing to some that they must
            clutch for it so desperately? He had even a painful amusement in watching the others. Of
            himself he thought little save to hope that under the boiling sea was rest and no return
            of memory. Then Brasidas called him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Quick! The others are Barbarians and you a Hellene. Your chance—leap!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He did not stir. The <span class="tei tei-q">“others”</span>—two strangers in Oriental dress—were striving to
            enter the pinnace. The seamen thrust their dirks out to force them back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Full enough!”</span> bawled the <span class="tei tei-q">“governor.”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“That fellow on the poop is mad. Cut the rope, or we are caught in the swirl.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The elder Barbarian lifted his companion as if to fling him into the boat, but
            Brasidas’s sword cut the one cable. The wave flung the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span> and
            the pinnace asunder. With stolid resignation the Orientals retreated to the poop. The
            people in the pinnace rowed desperately to keep her out of the deadly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trough of the billows, but Glaucon stood erect on the drifting
            wreck and his voice rang through the tumult of the sea. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell them in Athens, and tell Hermione my wife, that Glaucon the Alcmæonid went down
              into the deep declaring his innocence and denouncing the vengeance of Athena on
              whosoever foully destroyed him!—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Brasidas waved his sword in last farewell. Glaucon turned back to the wreck. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span> had settled lower. Every wave washed across the waist.
            Nothing seemed to meet his gaze save the leaden sky, the leaden green water, the foam of
            the bounding storm-crests. He told himself the gods were good. Drowning was more
            merciful death than hemlock. Pelagos, the untainted sea, was a softer grave than the
            Barathrum. The memory of the fearful hour at Colonus, the vision of the face of
            Hermione, of all things else that he would fain forget—all these would pass. For what
            came after he cared nothing. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So for some moments he stood, clinging upon the poop, awaiting the end. But the end
            came slowly. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span> was a stoutly timbered ship. Much of her
            lading had been cast overboard, but more remained and gave buoyancy to the wreckage. And
            as the Athenian awaited, almost impatiently, the final disaster, something called his
            eye away from the heaving sky-line. Human life was still about him. Wedged in a refuge,
            betwixt two capstans, the Orientals were sitting, awaiting doom like himself. But wonder
            of wonders,—he had not relaxed his hold on life too much to marvel,—the younger
            Barbarian was beyond all doubt a woman. She sat in her companion’s lap, lifting her
            white face to his, and Glaucon knew she was of wondrous beauty. They were talking
            together in some Eastern speech. Their arms were closely twined. It was plain they were
            passing the last love messages before entering the great mystery together. Of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Glaucon they took no heed. And he at first was almost
            angered that strangers should intrude upon this last hour of life. But as he looked, as
            he saw the beauty of the woman, the sheen of her golden hair, the interchange of love by
            touch and word,—there came across his own spirit a most unlooked-for change. Suddenly
            the white-capped billows seemed pitiless and chill. The warm joy of life returned. Again
            memory surged back, but without its former pang. He saw again the vision of Athens, of
            Colonus, of Eleusis-by-the-Sea. He saw Hermione running through the throng to meet him
            the day he returned from the Isthmia. He heard the sweet wind singing over the old
            olives beside the cool Cephissus. Must these all pass forever? forever? Were life,
            friends, love, the light of the sun, eternally lost, and nothing left save the endless
            sleep in the unsunned caves of Oceanus? With one surge the desire to live, to bear hard
            things, to conquer them, returned. He dashed the water from his eyes. What he did next
            was more by instinct than by reason. He staggered across the reeling deck, approached
            the Barbarians, and seized the man by the arm. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you live and not die? Up, then,—there is still a chance.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The man gazed up blankly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We are in Mazda’s hands,”</span> he answered in foreign accent. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is manifestly his
              will that we should pass now the Chinvat bridge. We are helpless. Where is the
              pinnace?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon dragged him roughly to his feet. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know your gods. Do not speak of their will to destroy us till the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Save her, let me twice perish.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Rouse yourself, then. One hope is left!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What hope?”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span>
          <a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A raft. We can cast a spar overboard. It will float us. You look strong,—aid me.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The man rose and, thoroughly aroused, seconded the Athenian intelligently and
            promptly. The lurches of the merchantman told how close she was to her end. One of the
            seamen’s axes lay on the poop. Glaucon seized it. The foremast was gone and the
            mainmast, but the small boat-mast still stood, though its sail had blown to a thousand
            flapping streamers. Glaucon laid his axe at the foot of the spar. Two fierce strokes
            weakened so that the next lurch sent it crashing overboard. It swung in the mælstrom by
            its stays and the halyards of the sail. Tossing to and fro like a bubble, it was a
            fearful hope, but a louder rumbling from the hold warned how other hope had fled. The
            Barbarian recoiled as he looked on it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It can never float through this storm,”</span> Glaucon heard him crying between the
            blasts, but the Athenian beckoned him onward. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Leap!”</span> commanded Glaucon; <span class="tei tei-q">“spring as the mast rises on the next wave.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot forsake her,”</span> called back the man, pointing to the woman, who lay with
            flying hair between the capstans, helpless and piteous now that her lover was no longer
            near. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I will provide for her. Leap!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon lifted the woman in his arms. He took a manner of pride in showing the
            Barbarian his skill. The man looked at him once, saw he could be trusted, and took the
            leap. He landed in the water, but caught the <a name="corr157" id="corr157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">sail-cloth</span> drifting from the mast, climbed
            beside it, and sat astride. The Athenian sprang at the next favoring wave. His burden
            made the task hard, but his stadium training never stood in better stead. The cold water
            closed around him. The wave dragged down in its black abyss, but he struck boldly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>upward, was beside the friendly spar, and the Barbarian
            aided him to mount beside him, then cut the lashings to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span>
            with the dagger that still dangled at his belt. The billows swept them away just as the
            wreck reared wildly, and bow foremost plunged into the deep. They bound the woman—she
            was hardly conscious now—into the little shelter formed by the junction of the broken
            sail-yard and the mast. The two men sat beside her, shielding her with their bodies from
            the beat of the spray. Speech was all but impossible. They were fain to close their eyes
            and pray to be delivered from the unceasing screaming of the wind, the howling of the
            waters. And so for hours.... </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon never knew how long they thus drifted. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span> had
            been smitten very early in the morning. She had foundered perhaps at noon. It may have
            been shortly before sunset—though Helios never pierced the clouds that storm-racked
            day—when Glaucon knew that the Barbarian was speaking to him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Look!”</span> The wind had lulled a little; the man could make himself heard. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is
              it?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Through the masses of gray spray and driving mist Glaucon gazed when the next long
            wave tossed them. A glimpse,—but the joys of Olympus seemed given with that sight;
            wind-swept, wave-beaten, rock-bound, that half-seen ridge of brown was land,—and land
            meant life, the life he had longed to fling away in the morning, the life he longed to
            keep that night. He shouted the discovery to his companion, who bowed his head,
            manifestly in prayer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The wind bore them rapidly. Glaucon, who knew the isles of the Ægean as became a
            Hellene, was certain they drove on Astypalæa, an isle subject to Persia, though one of
            the outermost Cyclades. The woman was in no state to realize their crisis. Only a hand
            laid on her bosom told that her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heart still fluttered.
            She could not endure the surge and the suffocating spray much longer. The two men sat in
            silence, but their eyes went out hungrily toward the stretch of brown as it lifted above
            the wave crests. The last moments of the desperate voyage crept by like the pangs of
            Tantalus. Slowly they saw unfolding the fog-clothed mountains, a forest, scattered bits
            of white they knew were stuccoed houses; but while their eyes brought joy, their ears
            brought sadness. The booming of the surf upon an outlying ledge grew ever clearer.
            Almost ere they knew it the drifting mast was stayed with a shock. They saw two rocks
            swathed in dripping weed that crusted with knife-like barnacles, thrust their black
            heads out of the boiling water. And beyond—fifty paces away—the breakers raced up the
            sandy shore where waited refuge. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The spar wedged fast in the rocks. The waves beat over it pitilessly. He who stayed by
            it long had better have sunk with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span>,—his would have been
            an easier death. Glaucon laid his mouth to the man’s ear. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Swim through the surf. I will bear the woman safely.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Save her, and be you blessed forever. I die happy. I cannot swim.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The moment was too terrible for Glaucon to feel amazed at this confession. To a
            Hellene swimming was second nature. He thought and spoke quickly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Climb on the higher rock. The wave does not cover it entirely. Dig your toes in the
              crevices. Cling to the seaweed. I will return for you.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He never heard what the other cried back to him. He tore the woman clear of her
            lashings, threw his left arm about her, and fought his way through the surf. He could
            swim like a Delian, the best swimmers in Hellas; but the task was mighty even for the
            athlete. Twice the deadly undertow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>almost dragged him
            downward. Then the soft sand was oozing round his feet. He knew a knot of fisher folk
            were running to the beach, a dozen hands took his fainting burden from him. One instant
            he stood with the water rushing about his ankles, gasped and drew long breaths, then
            turned his face toward the sea. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you crazed?”</span> he heard voices clamouring—they seemed a great way off,—<span class="tei tei-q">“a
              miracle that you lived through the surf once! Leave the other to fate. Phorcys has
              doomed him already.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Glaucon was past acting by reason now. His head seemed a ball of fire. Only his
            hands and feet responded mechanically to the dim impulse of his bewildered brain. Once
            more the battling through the surf, this time against it and threefold harder. Only the
            man whose strength had borne the giant Spartan down could have breasted the billows that
            came leaping to destroy him. He felt his powers were strained to the last notch. A
            little more and he knew he might roll helpless, but even so he struggled onward. Once
            again the two black rocks were springing out of the swollen water. He saw the Barbarian
            clinging desperately to the higher. Why was he risking his life for a man who was not a
            Hellene, who might be even a servant of the dreaded Xerxes? A strange moment for such
            questionings, and no time to answer! He clung to the seaweed beside the Barbarian for an
            instant, then through the gale cried to the other to place his hands upon his shoulders.
            The Oriental complied intelligently. For a third time Glaucon struggled across the
            raging flood. The passage seemed endless, and every receding breaker dragging down to
            the graves of Oceanus. The Athenian knew his power was failing, and doled it out as a
            miser, counting his strokes, taking deep gulps of air between each wave. Then, even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>while consciousness and strength seemed passing together,
            again beneath his feet were the shifting sands, again the voices encouraging, the hands
            outstretched, strange forms running down into the surf, strange faces all around him.
            They were bearing him and the Barbarian high upon the beach. They laid him on the hard,
            wet sand—never a bed more welcome. He was naked. His feet and hands bled from the
            tearing of stones and barnacles. His head was in fever glow. Dimly he knew the Barbarian

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The other barely raised his head. <span class="tei tei-q">“In Athens, Glaucon the Alcmæonid, but now I am
              without name, without country.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Oriental answered by kneeling on the sands and touching his head upon them close
            to Glaucon’s feet. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mardonius—arch foe of Hellas!”</span> Glaucon spoke the words in horror. Then reaction
            from all he had undergone robbed him of sense. They carried him to the fisher-village.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Six days later a Byzantine corn-ship brought from Amorgos to Peiræus two survivors of

            from a fearful peril. As for Hermione, her father took her to Eleusis that she might be
            free from the hoots of the people. Themistocles went about his business very sorrowful.
            Cimon lost half his gayety. Democrates, too, appeared terribly worn. <span class="tei tei-q">“How he loved his
              friend!”</span> said every admirer. Beyond doubt for long Democrates was exceeding
            thoughtful. Perhaps a reason for this was that about a month after the going of Glaucon
            he learned from Sicinnus that Prince Mardonius was at length in Sardis,—and possibly
            Democrates knew on what vessel the carpet-seller had taken flight. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When Glaucon awoke to consciousness, it was with a sense of absolute weakness, at the
            same moment with a sense of absolute rest. He knew that he was lying on pillows <span class="tei tei-q">“softer than sleep,”</span> that the air he breathed was laden with perfume, that the
            golden light which came through his half-closed eyelids was deliciously tempered, that
            his ears caught a musical murmur, as of a plashing fountain. So he lay for long, too
            impotent, too contented to ask where he lay, or whence he had departed. Athens,
            Hermione, all the thousand and one things of his old life, flitted through his brain,
            but only as vague, far shapes. He was too weak even to long for them. Still the fountain
            plashed on, and mingling with the tinkling he thought he heard low flutes breathing.
            Perhaps it was only a phantasy of his flagging brain. Then his eyes opened wider. He
            lifted his hand. It was a task even to do that little thing,—he was so weak. He looked
            at the hand! Surely his own, yet how white it was, how thin; the bones were there, the
            blue veins, but all the strength gone out of them. Was this the hand that had flung
            great Lycon down? It would be mere sport for a child to master him now. He touched his
            face. It was covered with a thick beard, as of a long month’s growth. The discovery <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>startled him. He strove to rise on one elbow. Too weak!
            He sank back upon the cushions and let his eyes rove inquiringly. Never had he seen
            tapestries the like of those that canopied his bed. Scarlet and purple and embroidered
            in gold thread with elaborate hunting scenes,—the dogs, the chariots, the slaying of
            the deer, the bearing home of the game. He knew the choicest looms of Sidon must have
            wrought them. And the linen, so cool, so grateful, underneath his head—was it not the
            almost priceless fabric of Borsippa? He stirred a little, his eyes rested on the floor.
            It was covered with a rug worth an Athenian patrician’s ransom,—a lustrous, variegated
            sheen, showing a new tint at each change of the light. So much he saw from the bed, and
            curiosity was wakened. Again he put forth his hand, and touched the hanging curtains.
            The movement set a score of little silver bells that dangled over the canopy to
            jingling. As at a signal the flutes grew louder, mingling with them was the clearer note
            of lyres. Now the strains swelled sweetly, now faded away into dreamy sighing, as if
            bidding the listener to sink again into the arms of sleep. Another vain effort to rise
            on his elbow. Again he was helpless. Giving way to the charm of the music, he closed his
            eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Either I am awaking in Elysium, or the gods send to me pleasant dreams before I
            die.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was feebly wondering which was the alternative when a new sound roused him, the
            sweep and rustle of the dresses of two women as they approached the bed. He gazed forth
            listlessly, when lo! above his couch stood two strangers,—strangers, but either as fair
            as Aphrodite arising from the sea. Both were tall, and full of queenly grace, both were
            dressed in gauzy white, but the hair of the one was of such gold that Glaucon hardly saw
            the circlet which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pressed over it. Her eyes were blue,
            the lustre of her face was like a white rose. The other’s hair shone like the wing of a
            raven. A wreath of red poppies covered it, but over the softly tinted forehead there
            peered forth a golden snake with emerald eyes—the Egyptian uræus, the crown of a
            princess from the Nile. Her eyes were as black as the other’s were blue, her lips as red
            as the dye of Tyre, her hands—But before Glaucon looked and wondered more, the first,
            she of the golden head, laid her hand upon his face,—a warm, comforting hand that
            seemed to speed back strength and gladness with the touch. Then she spoke. Her Greek was
            very broken, yet he understood her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you quite awakened, dear Glaucon?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He looked up marvelling, not knowing how to answer; but the golden goddess seemed to
            expect none from him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is now a month since we brought you from Astypalæa. You have wandered close to the
              Portals of the Dead. We feared you were beloved by Mazda too well, that you would
              never wake that we might bless you. Night and day have my husband and I prayed to
              Mithra the Merciful and Hauratât the Health-Giver in your behalf; each sunrise, at our
              command, the Magians have poured out for you the Haôma, the sacred juice dear to the
              Beautiful Immortals, and Amenhat, wisest of the physicians of Memphis, has stood by
              your bedside without rest. Now at last our prayers and his skill have conquered; you
              awake to life and gladness.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon lay wondering, not knowing how to reply, and only understanding in half, when
            the dark-haired goddess spoke, in purer Greek than her companion. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And I, O Glaucon of Athens, would have you suffer me to kiss your feet. For you have
              given my brother and my sister back to life.”</span> Then drawing near she took his hand
            in hers, while the two smiling looked down on him. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then at last he found tongue to speak. <span class="tei tei-q">“O gracious Queens, for such you are, forgive
              my roving wits. You speak of great service done. But wise Zeus knoweth we are
              strangers—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The golden goddess tossed her shining head and smiled,—still stroking with her hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dear Glaucon, do you remember the Eastern lad you saved from the Spartans at the
              Isthmus? Behold him! Recall the bracelet of turquoise,—my first gratitude. Then again
              you saved me with my husband. For I am the woman you bore through the surf at the
              island. I am Artazostra, wife of Mardonius, and this is Roxana, his half-sister, whose
              mother was a princess in Egypt.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon passed his fingers before his face, beckoning back the past. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is all far away and strange: the flight, the storm, the wreck, the tossing spar,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not try. Lie still. Grow strong and glad, and suffer us to teach you,”</span>
            commanded Artazostra. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Where do I lie? We are not upon the rocky islet still?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ladies laughed, not mockingly but so sweetly he wished that they would never
            cease. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is Sardis,”</span> spoke Roxana, bending over him; <span class="tei tei-q">“you lie in the palace of the

            smooth-shaven, approached the bed. He held out a broad gold cup, the rim whereof glinted
            with agate and sardonyx. He had no Greek, but Roxana took the cup from him and held it
            to Glaucon’s lips. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Drink,”</span> she commanded, and he was fain to obey. The Athenian felt the heavily
            spiced liquor laying hold of him. His eyes closed, despite his wish to gaze longer on
            the two beautiful women. He felt their hands caressing his cheeks. The music grew ever
            softer. He thought he was sinking into a kind of euthanasy, that his life was drifting
            out amid delightful dreams. But not cold Thanatos, but health-bearing Hypnos was the god
            who visited him now. When next he woke, it was with a clearer vision, a sounder mind. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sardis the Golden, once capital of the Lydian kings and now of the Persian satraps,
            had recovered from the devastation by the Ionians in their ill-starred revolt seventeen
            years preceding. The city spread in the fertile Sardiene, one of the garden plains of
            Asia Minor. To the south the cloud-crowned heights of Tmolus ever were visible. To the
            north flowed the noble stream of Hebrus, whilst high above the wealthy town, the busy
            agora, the giant temple of Lydian Cybele, rose the citadel of Meles, the palace fortress
            of the kings and the satraps. A frowning castle it was without, within not the
            golden-tiled palaces of Ecbatana and Susa boasted greater magnificence and luxury than
            this one-time dwelling of Crœsus. The ceilings of the wide banqueting halls rose on
            pillars of emerald Egyptian malachite. The walls were cased with onyx. Winged bulls that
            might have graced Nineveh guarded the portals. The lions upbearing the throne in the
            hall of audience were of gold. The mirrors in the <span class="tei tei-q">“House of the Women”</span> were not
            steel but silver. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The gorgeous carpets were sprinkled
            with rose water. An army of dark Syrian eunuchs and yellow-faced Tartar girls ran at the
            beck of the palace guests. Only the stealthy entrance of Sickness and Death told the
            dwellers here they were not yet gods. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Artaphernes, satrap of Lydia, had his divan, his viziers, and his audiences,—a court
            worthy of a king,—but the real lord of Western Asia was the prince who was nominally
            his guest. Mardonius had his own retinue and wing of the palace. On him fell the
            enormous task of organizing the masses of troops already pouring into Sardis, and he
            discharged his duty unwearyingly. The completion of the bridges of boats across the
            Hellespont, the assembling of the fleet, the collecting of provisions, fell to his
            province. Daily a courier pricked into Sardis with despatches from the Great King to his
            trusted general. Mardonius left the great levees and public spectacles to Artaphernes,
            but his hand was everywhere. His decisions were prompt. He was in constant communication
            with the Medizing party in Hellas. He had no time for the long dicing and drinking bouts
            the Persians loved, but he never failed to find each day an hour to spend with
            Artazostra his wife, with Roxana his half-sister, and with Glaucon his preserver. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Slowly through the winter health had returned to the Athenian. For days he had lain
            dreaming away the hours to the tune of the flutes and the fountains. When the warm
            spring came, the eunuchs carried him in a sedan-chair through the palace garden, whence
            he could look forth on the plain, the city, the snow-clad hills, and think he was on
            Zeus’s Olympian throne, surveying all the earth. Then it was he learned the Persian
            speech, and easily, for were not his teachers Artazostra and Roxana? He found it no
            difficult tongue, simple and much akin to Greek, and unlike most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the uncouth tongues the Oriental traders chattered in Sardis. The two
            women were constantly with him. Few men were admitted to a Persian harem, but Mardonius
            never grudged the Greek the company of these twain. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Noble Athenian,”</span> said the Prince, the first time he visited Glaucon’s bed, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
              are my brother. My house is yours. My friends are yours. Command us all.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Every day Glaucon was stronger. He tested himself with dumb-bells. Always he could
            lift a heavier weight. When the summer was at hand, he could ride out with Mardonius to
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Paradise,”</span> the satrap’s hunting park, and be in at the death of the deer. Yet
            he was no more the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fortunate Youth”</span> of Athens. Only imperfectly he himself knew
            how complete was the severance from his old life. The terrible hour at Colonus had made
            a mark on his spirit which not all Zeus’s power could take away. No doubt all the
            one-time friends believed him dead. Had Hermione’s confidence in him remained true?
            Would she not say <span class="tei tei-q">“guilty”</span> at last with all the rest? Mardonius might have
            answered, he had constant letters from Greece, but the Prince was dumb when Glaucon
            strove to ask of things beyond the Ægean. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Day by day the subtle influence of the Orient—the lotus-eating,—<span class="tei tei-q">“tasting the
              honey-sweet fruit which makes men choose to abide forever, forgetful of the homeward
              way”</span>—spread its unseen power over the Alcmæonid. Athens, the old pain, even the
            face of Hermione, would rise before him only dimly. He fought against this enchantment.
            But it was easier to renew his vow to return to Athens, after wiping out his shame, than
            to break these bands daily tightening. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He heard little Greek, now that he was learning Persian. Even he himself was changed.
            His hair and beard grew long, after the Persian manner. He wore the loose Median <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cloak, the tall felt cap of a Persian noble. The
            elaborate genuflexions of the Asiatics no longer astonished him. He learned to admire
            the valiant, magnanimous lords of the Persians. And Xerxes, the distant king, the
            wielder of all this power, was he not truly a god on earth, <span class="tei tei-sic">vicegerent</span> of
            Lord Zeus himself? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Forget you are a Hellene. We will talk of the Nile, not of the Cephissus,”</span>
            Artazostra said, whenever he spoke of home. Then she would tell of Babylon and
            Persepolis, and Mardonius of forays beside the wide Caspian, and Roxana of her girlhood,
            while Gobryas was satrap of Egypt, spent beside the magic river, of the Pharaohs, the
            great pyramid, of Isis and Osiris and the world beyond the dead. Before the Athenian was
            opened the golden East, its glitter, its wonderment, its fascination. He even was silent
            when his hosts talked boldly of the coming war, how soon the Persian power would rule
            from the Pillars of Heracles to Ind. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet once he stood at bay, showing that he was a Hellene still. They were in the
            garden. Mardonius had come to them where under the pomegranate tree the women spread
            their green tapestry which their nimble needles covered with a battle scene in scarlet.
            The Prince told of the capture and crucifixion of the chiefs of a futile revolt in
            Armenia. Then Artazostra clapped her hands to cry. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fools! Fools whom Angra-Mainyu the Evil smites blind that he may destroy them!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon, sitting at her feet, looked up quickly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Valiant fools, lady; every man
              must strike for his own country.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Artazostra shook her shining head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mazda gives victory to the king of Eran alone. Resisting Xerxes is not rebellion
              against man, it is rebellion against Heaven.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you sure?”</span> asked the Athenian, his eye lighting ominously. <span class="tei tei-q">“Are yours the
              greatest gods?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Roxana in turn cast down the tapestry and opened her arms with a charming gesture. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not angry, Glaucon, for will you not become one with us? I dare to prophesy like a
              seer from old Chaldea. Assur of Nineveh, Marduk of Babylon, Baal of Tyre, Ammon of
              Memphis—all have bent the knee to Mazda the Glorious, to Mithra the Fiend-Smiting,
              and shall the weak <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dævas</span></span>, the puny gods of Greece, save their
              land, when greater than they bow down in sore defeat?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet Glaucon still looked on her boldly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You have your mighty gods, but we have ours. Pray to your Mazda and Mithra, but we
              will still trust Zeus of the Thunders and Athena of the Gray Eyes, the bulwarks of our

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Persians shook their heads. It was time to return to the palace. All that Glaucon
            had seen of the Barbarian’s might, since awakening in Sardis, told him Xerxes was indeed
            destined to go forth conquering and to conquer. Then the vision of the Acropolis, the
            temples, the Guardian Goddess, returned. He banished all disloyal thoughts for the
            instant. The Prince walked with his wife, Glaucon with Roxana. He had always thought her
            <a name="corr173" id="corr173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">beautiful;</span> she had never seemed so beautiful as now. Did he imagine whither Mardonius
            perhaps was leading him? </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At last the lotus-eating ended. Repeated messengers told how Xerxes was quitting
            Babylon, was holding a muster in Cappadocia, and now was crossing Asia Minor toward
            Sardis. Mardonius and his companions had returned to that capital. Daily the soldiery
            poured into Sardis by tens of thousands. Glaucon knew now it was not a vain boast that
            for ten years the East had been arming against Hellas, that the whole power of the
            twenty satrapies would be flung as one thunderbolt upon devoted Greece. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the plain about Sardis a second city was rising, of wicker booths and gay
            pavilions. The host grew hourly. Now a band of ebony archers in leopard skins entered
            from far Ethiopia, now Bactrian battle-axemen, now yellow-faced Tartars from the
            northeast, now bright-turbaned Arabs upon their swaying camels,—Syrians, Cilicians,
            black-bearded Assyrians and Babylonians, thick-lipped Egyptians, came, and many a
            strange race more. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the core of the army were the serried files of Aryan horse and
            foot,—blond-headed, blue-eyed men, Persians and Medes, veterans of twenty victories.
            Their muscles were tempered steel. Their unwearying feet had tramped many a long
            parasang. Some were light infantry with wicker shields and powerful bows, but as many
            more horsemen in gold-scaled armour and with desert steeds that flew like Pegasus. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span>
          <a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The finest cavalry in the world!”</span> Mardonius vaunted, and his guest durst not
            answer nay. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Satrap after satrap came. When at last a foaming Arab galloping to the castle
            proclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Next morn the Lord of the World will enter Sardis,”</span> Glaucon could
            scarce have looked for a greater, though he had expected Cronian Zeus himself. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius, as <span class="tei tei-q">“bow-bearer to the king,”</span> a semi-regal office, rode forth a stage
            to meet the sovran. The streets of Sardis were festooned with flowers. Thousands of
            spearmen held back the crowds. The Athenian stood beside Roxana and Artazostra at the
            upper window of a Lydian merchant prince, and his eyes missed nothing. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Never had the two women seemed lovelier than when their hearts ran out to their
            approaching king. He felt now the power of personal sovranty, how these children of the
            East awaited not Xerxes the Master, but Xerxes the Omnipotent, God-Manifest, whose
            decrees were as the decrees of Heaven. And their awe could not fail to awe the Athenian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At noon the multitude caught the first token of the king. Down the road, through the
            gate, walked a man, bare-headed, bare-footed, alone,—Artaphernes, despot of all Lydia,
            going to pay his abject homage. Presently the eunuch priests of Cybele, perched above
            the gate, clashed their cymbals and raised their hymn of welcome. To the boom of drums
            the thousand chosen cavalry and as many picked footmen of the Life Guard entered, tall,
            magnificent soldiers,—caps and spear butts shining with gold. After these a gilded car
            drawn by the eight sacred horses, each milk-white, and on the car an altar bearing the
            eternal fire of Mazda. Then, each in his flashing chariot, moved the <span class="tei tei-q">“Six Princes,”</span>
            the heads of the great clans of the Achæmenians, then two hundred led desert horses, in
            splendid trappings, and then—after <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a long interval,
            that the host might cast no dust upon its lord, rode a single horseman on a jet-black
            steed, Artabanus—the king’s uncle and vizier. He beckoned to the people. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Have fear, Lydians, the giver of breath to all the world comes now beneath your
              gates!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The lines of soldiers flung down their spears and dropped upon their knees. The
            multitude imitated. A chariot came running behind four of the sacred steeds of
            Nisæa,—their coats were like new snow, their manes braided with gold thread, bridle,
            bits, pole, baseboard, shone with gems and the royal metal. The wheel was like the sun.
            A girl-like youth guided the crimson reins, a second held the tall green parasol. Its
            shadow did not hide the commanding figure upon the car. Glaucon looked hard. No
            mistaking—Xerxes was here, the being who could say to millions <span class="tei tei-q">“Die!”</span> and they
            perished like worms; in verity <span class="tei tei-q">“God-Manifest.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For in looks Xerxes, son of Darius, was surely the Great King. A figure of august
            height was set off nobly by the flowing purple caftan and the purple cap which crowned
            the curling black hair. The riches of satrapies were in the rubies and topazes on sword
            sheath and baldric. The head was raised. The face was not regular, but of a proud,
            aquiline beauty. The skin was olive, the eyes dark, a little pensive. If there were weak
            lines about the mouth, the curling beard covered them. The king looked straight on,
            unmoved by the kneeling thousands, but as he came abreast of the balcony, chance made
            him look upward. Perhaps the sight of the beautiful Greek caused Xerxes to smile
            winsomely. The smile of a god can intoxicate. Caught away from himself, Glaucon the
            Alcmæonid joined in the great salvo of cheering. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Victory to Xerxes! Let the king of kings reign forever!”</span><a name="corr176" id="corr176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chariot was gone almost instantly, a vast retinue—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cooks, eunuchs, grooms, hunters, and many closed litters bearing the royal
            concubines—followed, but all these passed before Glaucon shook off the spell the sight
            of royalty cast on him. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That night in the palace Xerxes gave a feast in honour of the new campaign. The
            splendours of a royal banquet in the East need no retelling. Silver lamps, carpets of
            Kerman rugs or of the petals of fresh roses, a thousand lutes and dulcimers, precious
            Helbon wine flowing like water, cups of Phœnician crystal, tables groaning with wild
            boars roasted whole, dancing women none too modest,—these were but the incidentals of a
            gorgeous confusion. To Glaucon, with the chaste loveliness of the Panathenæa before his
            mind, the scene was one of vast wonderment but scarcely of pleasure. The Persian did
            nothing by halves. In battle a hero, at his cups he became a satyr. Many of the scenes
            before the guests emptied the last of the tall silver tankards were indescribable. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the high dais above the roaring hall sat Xerxes the king,—adored, envied,
            pitiable. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When Spitames, the seneschal, brought him the cup, the bearer bowed his face, not
            daring to look on his dread lord’s eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When Artabanus, the vizier, approached with a message, he first kissed the carpet
            below the dais. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When Hydarnes, commander of the Life Guard, drew near to receive the watchword for the
            night, he held his mantle before his mouth, lest his breath pollute the world monarch. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet of all forms of seeming prosperity wherewith Fate can curse a man, the worst was
            the curse of Xerxes. To be called <span class="tei tei-q">“god”</span> when one is finite and mortal; to have no
            friends, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only a hundred million slaves; to be
            denied the joys of honest wish and desire because there were none left unsatisfied; to
            have one’s hastiest word proclaimed as an edict of deity; never to be suffered to
            confess a mistake, cost what the blunder might, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“king of kings”</span> might seem
            lifted above all human error; in short, to be the bondsman of one’s own
            deification,—this was the hard captivity of the lord of the twenty satrapies. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For Xerxes the king was a man,—of average instincts, capacities, goodness,
            wickedness. A god or a genius could have risen above his fearful isolation. Xerxes was
            neither. The iron ceremonial of the Persian court left him of genuine pleasures almost
            none. Something novel, a rare sensation, an opportunity to vary the dreary monotony of
            splendour by an astounding act of generosity or an act of frightful cruelty,—it
            mattered little which,—was snatched at by the king with childlike eagerness. And this
            night Xerxes was in an unwontedly gracious mood. At his elbow, as he sat on the throne
            cased with lapis lazuli and onyx, waited the one man who came nearest to being a friend
            and not a slave,—Mardonius, son of Gobryas, the bow-bearer,—and therefore more
            entitled than any other prince of the Persians to stand on terms of intimacy with his
            lord. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While Spitames passed the wine, the king hearkened with condescending and approving
            nod to the report of the Prince as to his mad adventure in Hellas. Xerxes even reproved
            his brother-in-law mildly for hazarding his own life and that of his wife among those
            stiff-necked tribesmen who were so soon to taste the Aryan might. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It was in your service, Omnipotence,”</span> the Prince was rejoining blandly; <span class="tei tei-q">“what if
              not I alone, but a thousand others of the noblest of the Persians and the Medes may
              perish, if only the glory of their king is advanced?”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Nobly said; you are a faithful slave, Mardonius. I will remember you when I have

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He even reached forth and stroked the bow-bearer’s hand, a condescension which made
            the footstool-bearer, parasol-bearer, quiver-bearer, and a dozen great lords more gnaw
            their lips with envy. Hydarnes, the commander who had waited an auspicious moment, now
            thought it safe to kneel on the lowest step of the throne. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Omnipotence, I am constrained to tell you that certain miserable Hellenes have been
              seized in the camp to-night—spies sent to pry out your power. Do you deign to have
              them impaled, crucified, or cast into the adders’ cage?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The king smiled magnanimously. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall not die. Show them the host, and all my power. Then send them home to
              their fellow-rebels to tell the madness of dreaming to withstand my might.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The smile of Xerxes had spread, like the ripple from a pebble splashing in a pool,
            over the face of every nobleman in hearing. Now their praises came as a chant. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O Ocean of Clemency and Wisdom! Happy Eran in thy sagacious yet merciful king!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes, not heeding, turned to Mardonius. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! yes,—you were telling how you corrupted one of the chief Athenians, then had to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But well that Mardonius had deprecated the wrath of the monarch. Glaucon came with his
            head high, his manner almost arrogant. The mere fact that his boldness might cost him
            his life made him less bending than ever. He trod firmly upon the particular square of
            golden carpet at the foot of the dais which none, saving the king, the vizier, and the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Six Princes,”</span> could lawfully tread. He held his hands at his sides, firmly
            refusing to conceal them in his cloak, as court etiquette demanded. As he stood on the
            steps of the throne, he gave the glittering monarch the same familiar bow he might have
            awarded a friend he met in the Agora. Mardonius was troubled. The supreme usher was
            horrified. The master-of-punishments, ever near his chief, gazed eagerly to see if
            Xerxes would not touch the audacious Hellene’s girdle—a sign for prompt decapitation.
            Only the good nature of the king prevented a catastrophe, and Xerxes was moved by two
            motives, pleasure at meeting a fellow-mortal who could look him in the eye without
            servility or fear, delight at the beautiful features and figure of the Athenian. For an
            instant monarch and fugitive looked face to face, then Xerxes stretched out, not his
            hand, but the gold tip of his ivory baton. Glaucon had wisdom enough to touch it,—a
            token that he was admitted to audience with the king. </p>

            question was a natural one for an Oriental. Glaucon’s answer came with increased pride. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a child of my parent’s old age. My mother is dead. My father is feeble. I have

            his own for an instant, that they brought him a flowing purple robe, and clasped about
            his waist a golden belt, every link set with a stone of price. The hall arose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en masse</span></span> to drink to the man whom the sovran delighted to honour. </p>

            approached it. As he made his way out of the banqueting hall, a score of noblemen,
            captains of thousands, over-eunuchs, and more trailed at his heels, salaaming, fawning,
            congratulating, offering all manner of service. Not on the days following his victory at
            the Isthmia had his head been in such a whirl. He hardly heard the well-meant warning

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon’s longing for the old life ebbed and flowed. Sometimes the return of memory
            maddened him. Who had done it?—had forged that damning letter and then hid it with
            Seuthes? Themistocles? Impossible. Democrates?—<span class="tei tei-q">“the friend with the understanding
              heart no less than a brother dear,”</span> as Homer said? More impossible. An unknown
            enemy, then, had stolen the fleet order from Themistocles? But what man had hated
            Glaucon? One answer remained,—unwittingly the athlete had offended some god, forgotten
            some vow, or by sheer good fortune had awakened divine jealousy. Poseidon had been
            implacable toward Odysseus, Athena toward Hector, Artemis toward Niobe,—Glaucon could
            only pray that his present welcome amongst the Persians might not draw down another
            outburst of Heaven’s anger. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More than all else was the keen longing for Hermione. He saw her in the night. Vainly,
            amidst the storms of the gathering war, he had sought a messenger to Athens. In this he
            dared ask no help from Mardonius. Then almost from the blue a bolt fell that made him
            wish to tear Hermione from his heart. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A Carian slave, a trusted steward at the Athenian silver mines of Laurium, had loved
            his liberty and escaped to Sardis. The Persians questioned him eagerly, for he knew all
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gossip of Athens. Glaucon met the runaway, who did
            not know then who he was, so many Greek refugees were always fluttering around the
            king’s court. The Carian told of a new honour for Democrates. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet, he communed in his heart, was it not best? Was he not dead to Athens? Must

            to see if he would touch the cup. He drank deeply. They applauded him. He remained long
            at the wine, the slaves bore him home drunken. In the morning Mardonius said Xerxes
            ordered him to serve in the cavalry guards, a post full of honour and chance for
            promotion. Glaucon did not resist. Mardonius sent him a silvered cuirass and a black
            horse from the steppes of Bactria,—fleet as the north wind. In his new armour he went
            to the chambers of Artazostra and Roxana. They had never seen him in panoply before. The

            her jet-black hair, the fine dark profile of her face, her delicate nostrils, the sweep
            of drapery that half revealed the form so full of grace. Was there more than passing

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I thank you for your fair hopes. Farewell.”</span> That was all he said, but as he went

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The hosts gathered daily. Xerxes spent his time in dicing, hunting, drinking, or
            amusing himself with his favourite by-play, wood-carving. He held a few solemn state
            councils, at which he appeared to determine all things and was actually guided by
            Artabanus and Mardonius. Now, at last, all the colossal machinery which was to crush
            down Hellas was being set in motion. Glaucon learned how futile was Themistocles’s hope
            of succour to Athens from the Sicilian Greeks, for,—thanks to Mardonius’s indefatigable
            diplomacy,—it was arranged that the Phœnicians of Carthage should launch a powerful
            armament against the Sicilians, the same moment Xerxes descended on Sparta and Athens.
            With calm satisfaction Mardonius watched the completion of his efforts. All was
            ready,—the army of hundreds of thousands, the twelve hundred war-ships, the bridges
            across the Hellespont, the canal at Mt. Athos. Glaucon’s admiration for the son of
            Gobryas grew apace. Xerxes was the outward head of the attack on Hellas. Mardonius was
            the soul. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He was the idol of the army—its best archer
            and rider. Unlike his peers, he maintained no huge harem of jealous concubines and
            conspiring eunuchs. Artazostra he worshipped. Roxana he loved. He had no time for other
            women. No servant of Xerxes seemed outwardly more obedient than he. Night and day he
            wrought for the glory of Persia. Therefore, Glaucon looked on him with dread. In him
            Themistocles and Leonidas would find a worthy foeman. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Daily Glaucon felt the Persian influence stealing upon him. He grew even accustomed to
            think of himself under his new name. Greeks were about him: Demaratus, the outlawed <span class="tei tei-q">“half-king”</span> of Sparta, and the sons of Hippias, late tyrant of Athens. He scorned
            the company of these renegades. Yet sometimes he would ask himself wherein was he better
            than they,—had Democrates’s accusation been true, could he have asked a greater reward
            from the Barbarian? And what he would do on the day of battle he did not dare to ask of
            his own soul. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes left Sardis with the host amidst the same splendour with which he had entered.
            Glaucon rode in the Life Guard, and saw royalty frequently, for the king loved to meet
            handsome men. Once he held the stirrup as Xerxes dismounted—an honour which provoked
            much envious grumbling. Artazostra and Roxana travelled in their closed litters with the
            train of women and eunuchs which followed every Persian army. Thus the myriads rolled
            onward through Lydia and Mysia, drinking the rivers dry by their numbers; and across the
            immortal plains of Troy passed that army which was destined to do and suffer greater
            things than were wrought beside the poet-sung Simois and Scamander, till at last they
            came to the Hellespont, the green <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>river seven furlongs
            wide, that sundered conquered Asia from the Europe yet to be conquered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Here were the two bridges of ships, more than three hundred in each, held by giant
            cables, and which upbore a firm earthen road, protected by a high bulwark, that the
            horses and camels might take no fright at the water. Here, also, the fleet met
            them,—the armaments of the East, Phœnicians, Cilicians, Egyptians, Cyprians,—more
            triremes and transports than had ever before ridden upon the seas. And as he saw all
            this power, all directed by one will, Glaucon grew even more despondent. How could puny,
            faction-rent Hellas bear up against this might? Only when he looked on the myriads
            passing, and saw how the captains swung long whips and cracked the lash across the backs
            of their spearmen, as over driven cattle, did a little comfort come. For he knew there
            was still a fire in Athens and Sparta, a fire not in Susa nor in Babylon, which kindled
            free souls and free hands to dare and do great things. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom will the high Zeus
              prosper when the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">slaves</span></span> of Xerxes stand face to face with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">men</span></span>?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A proud thought,—but it ceased to comfort him, as all that afternoon he stood near
            the marble throne of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the World,”</span> whence Xerxes overlooked his myriads
            while they filed by, watched the races of swift triremes, and heard the proud assurances
            of his officers that <span class="tei tei-q">“no king since the beginning of time, not Thothmes of Egypt, not
              Sennacherib of Assyria, not Cyrus nor Darius, had arrayed such hosts as his that

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then evening came. Glaucon was, after his wont, in the private pavilion of
            Mardonius,—itself a palace walled with crimson tapestry in lieu of marble. He sat
            silent and moody for long, the bright fence of the ladies or of the bow-bearer seldom
            moving him to answer. And at last Artazostra could endure it no more. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Beautiful,”</span> answered Mardonius and Artazostra together. And Roxana, with an

            smouldered on the brazier, the dark lustre of the singer’s eyes—all held Glaucon as by
            a spell. Roxana struck the harp. Her voice was sweet, and more than desire to please
            throbbed through the strings and song. </p>

            of Athens. He felt the warm glow in his cheeks; he felt subtle hands outstretching as if
            drawing forth his spirit. Roxana’s eyes were upon him as she ended. Their gaze met. She
            was very fair, high-born, sensitive. She was inviting him to put away Glaucon the
            outcast from Hellas, to become body and soul Prexaspes the Persian, <span class="tei tei-q">“Benefactor of the
              King,”</span> and sharer in all the glories of the conquering race. All the past seemed
            slipping away from him as unreal. Roxana stood before him in her dark Oriental beauty;
            Hermione was in Athens—and they were giving her in marriage to Democrates. What wonder
            he felt no mastery of himself, though all that day he had kept from wine? </p>

            not see the meaning glances exchanged by Mardonius and Artazostra before the latter left

            violet haze upon the hills and pure fire of the bay at Eleusis-by-the-Sea. Night by
            night the bird song would be stilled in the old olives along the dark waters. There
            Hermione would sit looking off into the void, as many another in like plight has sat and
            wearily waited, asking of the night and the sea the questions that are never answered.
            As the bay shimmered under the light of morning, she could gaze toward the brown crags
            of Salamis and the open Ægean beyond. The waves kept their abiding secret. The tall
            triremes, the red-sailed fishers’ boats, came and went from the havens of Athens, but
            Hermione never saw the ship that had borne away her all. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The roar and scandal following the unmasking of Glaucon had long since abated.
            Hermippus—himself full five years grayer on account of the calamity—had taken his
            daughter again to quiet Eleusis, where there was less to remind her of that terrible
            night at Colonus. She spent the autumn and winter in an unbroken shadow life, with only
            her mother and old Cleopis for companions. Reasons not yet told to the world gave her a
            little hope and comfort. But in mere desire to make her dark cloud break, her parents
            were continually giving Hermione pain. She guessed it long before her father’s wishes
            passed beyond vaguest hints. She heard <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him praising
            Democrates, his zeal for Athens and Hellas, his fair worldly prospects, and there needed
            no diviner to reveal Hermippus’s hidden meaning. Once she overheard Cleopis talking with
            another maid. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Her Ladyship has taken on terribly, to be sure, but I told her mother <span class="tei tei-q">‘when a fire

              console in another year.”</span>

              unwedded very long. Aphrodite didn’t make her to sit as an old maid carding wool and
              munching beans. One can see Hermippus’s and Lysistra’s purpose with half an eye.”</span>

            of giving her a sound whipping, but Cleopis mustered a bold front and a ready lie: </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ei!</span></span> dear little lady, don’t flash up so! I was only talking

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I heard you quite otherwise,”</span> was the nigh tremulous answer. But Hermione was not
            anxious to push matters to an issue. From the moment of Glaucon’s downfall she had
            believed—what even her own mother had mildly derided—that Democrates had been the
            author of her husband’s ruin. And now that the intent of her parents ever more clearly
            dawned on her, she was close upon despair. Hermippus, however,—whatever his
            purpose,—was considerate, nay kindly. He regarded Hermione’s feelings as pardonable, if
            not laudable. He would wait for time to soothe her. But the consciousness that her
            father purposed such a fate for her, however far postponed, was enough to double all the
            unanswered longing, the unstilled pain. </p>

            hope, across the end of the æons, to clasp hands even in the dim House of Hades with her
            glorious husband? If there was chance thereof, dark Hades would grow bright as Olympus.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet the early spring came back sweetly as ever. The warm breeze blew from Egypt.
            Philomela sang in the olive groves. The snows on Pentelicus faded. Around the city ran
            bands of children singing the <span class="tei tei-q">“swallow’s song,”</span> and beseeching the spring donation
            of honey cakes:— </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.80em; margin-left: 1.60em; margin-top: 0.80em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 80%">“</span><span style="font-size: 80%">She is here, she is here, the swallow;</span></span></div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 80%">Fair seasons bringing,—fair seasons to follow.</span><span style="font-size: 80%">”</span></span></div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And many a housewife, as she rewarded the singers, dropped a silent tear, wondering
            whether another spring would see the innocents anywhere save in a Persian slave-pen, or,
            better fate, in Orchus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet to one woman that spring there came consolation. On Hermippus’s door hung a glad
            olive wreath. Hermione had borne a son. <span class="tei tei-q">“The fairest babe she had ever seen,”</span> cried
            the midwife. <span class="tei tei-q">“Phœnix,”</span> the mother called him, <span class="tei tei-q">“for in him shall Glaucon the
              Beautiful live again.”</span> Democrates sent a runner every day to Eleusis to inquire for
            Hermione until all danger was passed. On the <span class="tei tei-q">“name-day,”</span> ten days <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>after the birth, he was absent from the gathering of friends and
            kinsmen, but sent a valuable statuette to Hermione, who left it, however, to her father
            to thank him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The day after Phœnix was born old Conon, Glaucon’s father, died. The old man had never
            recovered from the blow given by the dishonourable death of the son with whom he had so
            lately quarrelled. He left a great landed estate at Marathon to his new-born grandson.
            The exact value thereof Democrates inquired into sharply, and when a distant cousin
            talked of contesting the will, the orator announced he would defend the infant’s rights.
            The would-be plaintiff withdrew at once, not anxious to cross swords with this favourite
            of the juries, and everybody said that Democrates was showing a most scrupulous regard
            for his unfortunate friend’s memory. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Indeed, seemingly, Democrates ought to have been the happiest man in Athens. He had
            been elected <span class="tei tei-q">“strategus,”</span> to serve on the board of generals along with
            Themistocles. He had plenty of money, and gave great banquets to this or that group of
            prominent citizens. During the winter he had asked Hermippus for his daughter in
            marriage. The Eumolpid told him that since Glaucon’s fearful end, he was welcome as a
            son-in-law. Still he could not conceal that Hermione never spoke of him save in hate,
            and in view of her then delicate condition it was well not to press the matter. The
            orator had seemed well content. <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman’s fantasies would wear away in time.”</span> But
            the rumour of this negotiation, outrunning truth, grew into the lying report of an
            absolute betrothal,—the report which was to drift to Asia and turn Glaucon’s heart to
            stone, gossip having always wrought more harm than malignant lying. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet flies were in Democrates’s sweet ointment. He knew Themistocles hardly trusted him
            as frankly as of yore. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Little Simonides, a man of wide
            influence and keen insight, treated him very coldly. Cimon had cooled also. But worse
            than all was a haunting dread. Democrates knew, if hardly another in Hellas, that the
            Cyprian—in other words Mardonius—was safe in Asia, and likewise that he had fled on
            the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span>. Mardonius, then, had escaped the storm. What if the
            same miracle had saved the outlaw? What if the dead should awake? The chimera haunted
            Democrates night and day. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still he was beginning to shake off his terrors. He believed he had washed his hands
            fairly clean of his treason, even if the water had cost his soul. He joined with all his
            energies in seconding Themistocles. His voice was loudest at the Pnyx, counselling
            resistance. He went on successful embassies to Sicyon and Ægina to get pledges of
            alliance. In the summer he did his uttermost to prepare the army which Themistocles and
            Evænetus the Spartan led to defend the pass of Tempē. The expedition sailed amid high
            hopes for a noble defence of Hellas. Democrates was proud and sanguine. Then, like a
            thunderbolt, there came one night a knock at his door. Bias led to his master no less a
            visitor than the sleek and smiling Phœnician—Hiram. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The orator tried to cover his terrors by windy bluster. He broke in before the
            Oriental could finish his elaborate salaam. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your slave thinks otherwise,”</span> observed Hiram, humbly. <span class="tei tei-q">“If your Lordship will

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The next morning he made a formal visit to the shrine of the Furies in the hill of

            than pass this abode of Alecto, Megæra, and Tisiphone, pitiless pursuers of the guilty.
            The terrible sisters hounded a man through life, and after death to the judgment bar of
            Minos. With reason, therefore, the guilty dreaded them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates had brought the proper sacrifices—two black rams, which were duly
            slaughtered upon the little altar before the shrine and sprinkled with sweetened water.
            The priestess, a gray hag herself, asked her visitor if he would enter the cavern and
            proffer his petition to the mighty goddesses. Leaving his friends outside, the orator
            passed through the door which the priestess seemed to open in the side of the cave. He
            saw only a jagged, unhewn cranny, barely tall enough for a man to stand upright and
            reaching far into the sculptured rock. No image: only a few rough votive tablets set up
            by a grateful suppliant for some mercy from the awful goddesses. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She went forth. As the light vanished, Democrates seemed buried in the rock. Out of
            the blackness spectres were springing against him. From a cleft he heard a flapping, a
            bat, an imprisoned bird, or Alecto’s direful wings. He held his hands downward, for he
            had to address infernal goddesses, and prayed in haste. </p>

              men shall gather to reverence you forever.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But here he ceased. In the darkness moved something white. Again a flapping. He was
            sure the white thing was Glaucon’s face. Glaucon had perished at sea. He had never been
            buried, so his ghost was wandering over the world, seeking vainly for rest. It all came
            to Democrates in an instant. His knees smote together; his teeth chattered. He sprang
            back upon the door and forced it open, but never saw the dove that fluttered forth with
            him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A hideous place!”</span> he cried to his waiting friends. <span class="tei tei-q">“A man must have a stronger
              heart than mine to love to tarry after his prayer is finished.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Only a few days later Hellas was startled to hear that Tempē had been evacuated
            without a blow, and the pass left open to Xerxes. It was said Democrates, in his ever
            commendable activity, had discovered at the last moment the mountain wall was not as
            defensible as hoped, and any resistance would have been disastrous. Therefore, whilst
            the retreat was bewailed, everybody praised the foresight of the orator. Everybody—one
            should say, except two, Bias and Phormio. They had many conferences together, especially
            after the coming and going of Hiram. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is easy to praise the blessings of peace. Still easier to paint the horrors of
            war,—and yet war will remain for all time the greatest game at which human wits can
            play. For in it every form of courage, physical and moral, and every talent are called
            into being. If war at once develops the bestial, it also develops as promptly the
            heroic. Alone of human activities it demands a brute’s strength, an iron will, a
            serpent’s intellect, a lion’s courage—all in one. And of him who has these things in
            justest measure, history writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“He conquered.”</span> It was because Mardonius seemed to
            possess all these, to foresee everything, to surmount everything, that Glaucon despaired
            for the fate of Hellas, even more than when he beheld the crushing armaments of the
            Persian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet for long it seemed as if the host would march even to Athens without battle,
            without invoking Mardonius’s skill. The king crossed Thrace and Macedonia, meeting only
            trembling hospitality from the cities along his route. At Doriscus he had held a review
            of his army, and smiled when the fawning scribes told how one million seven hundred
            thousand foot and eighty thousand horse followed his banners.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> Every fugitive and spy from southern
            Hellas told how the hearts of the stanchest patriots were sinking, how everywhere save
            in Athens and Sparta loud voices urged the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sending of
              <span class="tei tei-q">“earth and water,”</span>—tokens of submission to the irresistible king. At the pass of
            Tempē covering Thessaly, Glaucon, who knew the hopes of Themistocles, had been
            certain the Hellenes would make a stand. Rumour had it that ten thousand Greek infantry
            were indeed there, and ready for battle. But the outlaw’s expectations were utterly
            shattered. To the disgust of the Persian lords, who dearly loved brisk fighting, it was
            soon told how the cowardly Hellenes had fled by ship, leaving the rich plains of
            Thessaly bare to the invader. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus was blasted Glaucon’s last hope. Hellas was doomed. He almost looked to see
            Themistocles coming as ambassador to bring the homage of Athens. Since his old life
            seemed closed to the outlaw, he allowed Mardonius to have his will with him,—to teach
            him to act, speak, think, as an Oriental. He even bowed himself low before the king, an
            act rewarded by being commanded one evening to play at dice with majesty itself. Xerxes
            was actually gracious enough to let his new subject win from him three handsome Syrian
            slave-boys. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You Hellenes are becoming wise,”</span> announced the monarch one day, when the Locrian

          </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You hear, Prexaspes,”</span> said Xerxes, mollified. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am glad, for the man who

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not fail to deserve it. Mardonius is always praising you. Consider also how much

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The next morning was the royal birthday. The army, pitched in the fertile plain by
            Thessalian Larissa, feasted on the abundance at hand. The king distributed huge
            largesses of money. All day long he sat in his palace-like tent, receiving
            congratulations from even the lowest of his followers, and bound in turn not to reject
            any reasonable petition. The Magi sacrificed blooded stallions and rare spices to Mithra
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of Wide Pastures,”</span> to Vohu-Manu the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Councillor,”</span> and all their
            other angels, desiring them to bless the arms of the king. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The <span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect Banquet”</span> of the birthday came in the evening. It hardly differed
            from the feast at Sardis. The royal pavilion had its poles plated with silver, the
            tapestries <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were green and purple, the couches were
            spread with gorgeous coverlets. Only the drinking was more moderate, the ceremonial less
            rigid. The fortunate guests devoured dainties reserved for the special use of royalty:
            the flour of the bread was from Assos, the wine from Helbon, the water to dilute the
            wine had come in silver flasks from the Choaspes by Susa. The king even distributed the
            special unguent of lion’s fat and palm wine which no subject, unpermitted, could use and
            shun the death penalty. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then at the end certain of the fairest of the women came and danced unveiled before
            the king—this one night when they might show forth their beauty. And last of all danced
            Roxana. She danced alone; a diaphanous drapery of pink Egyptian cotton blew around her
            as an evening cloud. From her black hair shone the diamond coronet. To the sensuous
            swing of the music she wound in and out before the king and his admiring lords,
            advancing, retreating, rising, swaying, a paragon of agility and grace, feet, body,
            hands, weaving their charm together. When at the end she fell on her knees before the
            king, demanding whether she had done well, the applause shook the pavilion. The king
            looked down on her, smiling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Rise, sister of Mardonius. All Eran rejoices in you to-night. And on this evening
              whose request can I fail to grant? Whose can I grant more gladly than yours? Speak;
              you shall have it, though it be for half my kingdoms.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The dancer arose, but hung down her flashing coronal. Her blush was enchanting. She
            stood silent, while the good-humoured king smiled down on her, till Artazostra came from
            her seat by Mardonius and whispered in her ear. Every neck in the crowded pavilion was
            craned as Artazostra spoke to Xerxes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“May it please my royal brother, this is the word of Rox<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ana. <span class="tei tei-q">‘I love my brother Mardonius; nevertheless, contrary to the

                youth who shall do me honour by the valiant deeds and the true service he shall
                render unto my Lord.’</span> ”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“A fair petition! Let the king grant it!”</span> shouted twenty; while others more wise
            whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“This was not done without foreknowledge by Mardonius.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes smiled benignantly and rubbed his nose with the lion’s fat while deliberating. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“An evil precedent, lady, an evil precedent when women demand husbands and do not wait

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The bow-bearer bowed obediently. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I hear the word of the king, and all his mandates are good. This is no meet time for

              rejoice to bestow my sister upon whatsoever fortunate servant the king may deign to
              honour.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You hear him, lady,”</span>—the royal features assumed a grin, which was reflected
            throughout the pavilion. <span class="tei tei-q">“A husband you shall have, but Mardonius shall be revenged.
              Your fate is in my hands. And shall not I,—guardian of the households of my

            trying to persuade all about that he was meditating. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Bardas, satrap of Sogandia, is old; he has but one eye; they say he beats his eleven
              wives daily with a whip of rhinoceros hide. It would be just if I gave him this woman

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The threatened lady fell again on her knees, outstretching her hands and beseeching
            mercy,—never a more charming picture of misery and contrition. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You tremble, lady,”</span> went on the sovran, <span class="tei tei-q">“and justly. It were better for my
              empire if my heart were less hard. After all, you danced so elegantly that I must be
              mollified. There is the young Prince Zophyrus, son of Datis the general,—he has only
              five wives already. True, he is usually the worse for wine, is not handsome, and
              killed one of his women not long since because she did not sing to please him.
              Yes—you shall have Zophyrus—he will surely rule you—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mercy, not Zophyrus, gracious Lord,”</span> pleaded the abject Egyptian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The king looked down on her, with a broader grin than ever. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are very hard to please. I ought to punish your wilfulness by some dreadful doom.
              Do not cry out again. I will not hear you. My decision is fixed. Mardonius shall
              bestow you in marriage to a man who is not even a Persian by birth, who one year since
              was a disobedient rebel against my power, who even now contemns and despises many of
              the good customs of the Aryans. Hark, then, to his name. When Hellas is conquered, I
              command that Mardonius wed you to the Lord Prexaspes.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The king broke into an uproarious laugh, a signal for the thousand loyal subjects
            within the great pavilion to roar with laughter also. In the confusion following
            Artazostra and Roxana disappeared. Fifty hands dragged the appointed bridegroom to the
            king, showering on him all manner of congratulations. Xerxes’s act was a plain proof
            that he was adopting the beautiful Hellene as one of his personal favourites,—a post of
            influence and honour not to be despised by a vizier. What <span class="tei tei-q">“Prexaspes”</span> said when he
            thanked the king was drowned in the tumult of laughing and cheering. The monarch,
            delighted to play the gracious god, roared his injunctions to the Athenian so loud that
            above the din they heard him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You will bridle her well, Prexaspes. I know them—those Egyptian fillies! They need a
              hard curb and the lash at times. Beware the tyranny of your own harem. I would not
              have the satrapies know how certain bright eyes in the seraglio can make the son of
              Darius play the fool. There is nothing more dangerous than women. It will take all
              your courage to master them. A hard task lies before you. I have given you one wife,
              but you know our good Persian custom—five, ten, or twenty. Take the score, I order
              you. Then in twelve years you’ll be receiving the prize a Persian king bestows every
              summer on the father of the most children!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And following this broad hint, the king held his sides with laughter again, a mirth
            which it is needless to say was echoed and reëchoed till it seemed it could not cease.
            Only a few ventured to mutter under breath: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Hellene will have a subsatrapy in the
              East before the season is over and a treasure of five thousand talents! Mithra wither

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The summer was waning when the host moved southward <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from Larissa, for mere numbers had made progress slow, and despite Mardonius’s
            providence the question of commissariat sometimes became difficult. Now at last, leaving
            behind Thrace and Macedonia, the army began to enter Greece itself. As it fared across
            the teeming plains of Thessaly, it met only welcome from the inhabitants and submissions
            from fresh embassies. Report came from the fleet—keeping pace with the land army along
            the coasts—that nowhere had the weak squadrons of the Greeks adventured a stand. Daily
            the smile of the Lord of the World grew more complacent, as his <span class="tei tei-q">“table-companions”</span>
            told him: <span class="tei tei-q">“The rumour of your Eternity’s advent stupefies the miserable Hellenes. Like
              Atar, the Angel of Fire, your splendour glitters afar. You will enter Athens and
              Sparta, and no sword leave its sheath, no bow its wrapper.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Every day Mardonius asked of Glaucon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Will your Hellenes fight?”</span> and the answer
            was ever more doubting, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Long since Glaucon had given up hope of the defeat of the Persian. Now he prayed
            devoutly there might be no useless shedding of blood. If only he could turn back and not
            behold the humiliation of Athens! Of the fate of the old-time friends—Democrates,
            Cimon, Hermione—he tried not to think. No doubt Hermione was the wife of Democrates.
            More than a year had sped since the flight from Colonus. Hermione had put off her
            mourning for the yellow veil of a bride. Glaucon prayed the war might bring her no new
            sorrow, though Democrates, of course, would resist Persia to the end. As for himself he
            would never darken their eyes again. He was betrothed to Roxana. With her he would seek
            one of those valleys in Bactria which she had praised, the remoter the better, and there
            perhaps was peace. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus the host wound through Thessaly, till before them rose, peak on peak, the jagged
            mountain wall of Othrys and Œta, fading away in violet distance, the bulwark of central
            Hellas. Then the king’s smile became a frown, for the Hellenes, undismayed despite his
            might, were assembling their fleet at northern Eubœa, and at the same time a tempest had
            shattered a large part of the royal navy. The Magi offered sacrifice to appease
            Tishtrya, the Prince of the Wind-ruling Stars, but the king’s frown grew blacker at each
            message. Glaucon was near him when at last the monarch’s thunders broke forth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A hot, sultry day. The king’s chariot had just crossed the mountain stream of the
            Sphercus, when a captain of a hundred came galloping, dismounted, and prostrated himself
            in the dust. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your tidings?”</span> demanded Xerxes, sharply. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Be gracious, Fountain of Mercy,”</span>—the captain evidently disliked his mission,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I am sent from the van. We came to a place where the mountains thrust down upon the
              sea and leave but a narrow road by the ocean. Your slaves found certain Hellenes,
              rebels against your benignant government, holding a wall and barring all passage to
              your army.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And did you not forthwith seize these impudent wretches and drag them hither to be
              judged by me?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Compassion, Omnipotence,”</span>—the messenger trembled,—<span class="tei tei-q">“they seemed sturdy,
              well-armed rogues, and the way was narrow and steep where a score can face a thousand.
              Therefore, your slave came straight with his tidings to the ever gracious king.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dog! Coward!”</span> Xerxes plucked the whip from the charioteer’s hand and lashed it
            over the wretch’s shoulders. <span class="tei tei-q">“By the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fravashi</span></span>, the soul of
              Darius my father, no man shall bring so foul a word to me and live!”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Compassion, Omnipotence, compassion!”</span> groaned the man, writhing like a worm.
            Already the master-of-punishments was approaching to cover his face with a towel,
            preparatory to the bow-string, but the royal anger spent itself just enough to avert a
            tragedy. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your life is forfeit, but I am all too merciful! Take then three hundred stripes on
              the soles of your feet and live to be braver in the future.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A thousand blessings on your benignity,”</span> cried the captain, as they led him away,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“I congratulate myself that insignificant as I am the king yet deigns to notice my
              existence even to recompense my shortcomings.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Off,”</span> ordered the bristling monarch, <span class="tei tei-q">“or you die the death yet. And do you,
              Mardonius, take Prexaspes, who somewhat knows this country, spur forward, and discover
              who are the madmen thus earning their destruction.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The command was obeyed. Glaucon galloped beside the Prince, overtaking the marching
            army, until as they cantered into the little mud-walled city of Heraclea a second
            messenger from the van met them with further details. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The pass is held by seven thousand Grecian men-at-arms. There are no Athenians. There
              are three hundred come from Sparta.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And their chief?”</span> asked Glaucon, leaning eagerly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Is Leonidas of Lacedæmon.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Then, O Mardonius,”</span> spoke the Athenian, with a throb in his voice not there an
            hour ago. <span class="tei tei-q">“There will be battle.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So, whether wise men or mad, the Hellenes were not to lay down their arms without one
            struggle, and Glaucon knew not whether to be sorry or to be proud. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A rugged mountain, an inaccessible morass, and beyond that morass the sea: the
            mountain thrusting so close upon the morass as barely to leave space for a narrow wagon
            road. This was the western gate of Thermopylæ. Behind the narrow defile the mountain and
            swamp-land drew asunder; in the still scanty opening hot springs gushed forth, sacred to
            Heracles, then again on the eastern side Mt. Œta and the impenetrable swamp drew
            together, forming the second of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hot Gates,”</span>—the gates which Xerxes must
            unlock if he would continue his march to Athens. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Great King’s couriers reported that the stubborn Hellenes had cast a wall across
            the entrance, and that so far from showing terror at the advent of majesty, were
            carelessly diverting themselves by athletic games, and by combing and adorning their
            hair, a fact which the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord Prexaspes”</span> at least comprehended to mean that Leonidas
            and his Spartans were preparing for desperate battle. Nevertheless, it was hard to
            persuade the king that at last he confronted men who would resist him to his face.
            Glaucon said it. Demaratus, the outlawed Spartan, said it. Xerxes, however, remained
            angry and incredulous. Four long days he and his army sat before the pass, <span class="tei tei-q">“because,”</span> announced his couriers, <span class="tei tei-q">“he wishes in his benignity to give these madmen
              a chance to flee away and shun destruction;”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“because,”</span> spoke those nearest to Mardonius, the
            brain of the army, <span class="tei tei-q">“there is hot fighting ahead, and the general is resolved to bring
              up the picked troops in the rear before risking a battle.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then on the fifth day either Xerxes’s patience was exhausted or Mardonius felt ready.
            Strong regiments of Median infantry were ordered to charge Leonidas’s position, Xerxes
            not failing to command that they slay as few of the wretches as possible, but drag them
            prisoners before his outraged presence. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A noble charge. A terrible repulse. For the first time those Asiatics who had
            forgotten Marathon discovered the overwhelming superiority that the sheathing of heavy
            armour gave the Greek hoplites over the lighter armed Median spearmen. The short lances
            and wooden targets of the attackers were pitifully futile against the long spears and
            brazen shields of the Hellenes. In the narrow pass the vast numbers of Barbarians went
            for nothing. They could not use their archers, they could not charge with their
            magnificent cavalry. The dead lay in heaps. The Medes attacked again and again. At last
            an end came to their courage. The captains laid the lash over their mutinous troops. The
            men bore the whips in sullen silence. They would not charge again upon those devouring
            spears. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> White with anger, Xerxes turned to Hydarnes and his <span class="tei tei-q">“Immortals,”</span> the infantry of
            the Life Guard. The general needed no second bidding. The charge was driven home with
            magnificent spirit. But what the vassal Medes could not accomplish, neither could the
            lordly Persians. The repulse was bloody. If once Leonidas’s line broke and the Persians
            rushed on with howls of triumph, it was only to see the Hellenes’ files close in a
            twinkling and return to the onset with their foes in confusion. Hydarnes led back his
            men <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at last. The king sat on the ivory throne just out
            of arrow shot, watching the ebb and flow of the battle. Hydarnes approached and
            prostrated himself. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Omnipotence, I the least of your slaves put my life at your bidding. Command that I
              forfeit my head, but my men can do no more. I have lost hundreds. The pass is not to
              be stormed.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Only the murmur of assent from all the well-tried generals about the throne saved
            Hydarnes from paying the last penalty. The king’s rage was fearful; men trembled to look
            on him. His words came so thick, the rest could never follow all his curses and
            commands. Only Mardonius was bold enough to stand up before his face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Eternity, this is an unlucky day. Is it not sacred to Angra-Mainyu the Evil? The
              arch-Magian says the holy fire gives forth sparks of ill-omen. Wait, then, till
              to-morrow. Verethraghna, the Angel of Victory, will then return to your servants.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The bow-bearer led his trembling master to the royal tent, and naught more of Xerxes
            was seen till the morning. All that night Mardonius never slept, but went unceasingly
            the round of the host preparing for battle. Glaucon saw little of him. The Athenian
            himself had been posted among the guard of nobles directly about the person of the king,
            and he was glad he was set nowhere else, otherwise he might have been ordered to join in
            the attack. Like every other in the host, he slept under arms, and never returned to
            Mardonius’s pavilion. His heart had been in his eyes all that day. He had believed
            Leonidas would be swept from the pass at the first onset. Even he had underrated the
            Spartan prowess. The repulse of the Medes had astonished him. When Hydarnes reeled back,
            he could hardly conceal his joy. The Hellenes were fighting! The Hellenes were
            conquering! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He forgot he stood almost at Xerxes’s side
            when the last charge failed; and barely in time did he save himself from joining in the
            shout of triumph raised by the defenders when the decimated Immortals slunk away. He had
            grown intensely proud of his countrymen, and when he heard the startled Persian lords
            muttering dark forbodings of the morrow, he all but laughed his gladness in their faces. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So the night passed for him: the hard earth for a bed, a water cruse wrapped in a
            cloak for a pillow. And just as the first red blush stole over the green Malian bay and
            the mist-hung hills of Eubœa beyond, he woke with all the army. Mardonius had used the
            night well. Chosen contingents from every corps were ready. Cavalrymen had been
            dismounted. Heavy masses of Assyrian archers and Arabian slingers were advanced to
            prepare for the attack by overwhelming volleys. The Persian noblemen, stung to madness
            by their king’s reproaches and their own sense of shame, bound themselves by fearful
            oaths never to draw from the onset until victorious or dead. The attack itself was led
            by princes of the blood, royal half-brothers of the king. Xerxes sat again on the ivory
            throne, assured by every obsequious tongue that the sacred fire gave fair omens, that
            to-day was the day of victory. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The attack was magnificent. For an instant its fury seemed to carry the Hellenes back.
            Where a Persian fell two stepped over him. The defenders were swept against their wall.
            The Barbarians appeared to be storming it. Then like the tide the battle turned. The
            hoplites, locking shields, presented an impenetrable spear hedge. The charge spent
            itself in empty promise. Mardonius, who had been in the thickest, nevertheless drew off
            his men skilfully and prepared to renew the combat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the interval Glaucon, standing by the king, could see a short, firm figure in black
            armour going in and out among the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hellenes, ordering
            their array—Leonidas—he needed no bird to tell him. And as the Athenian stood and
            watched, saw the Persians mass their files for another battering charge, saw the Great
            King twist his beard whilst his gleaming eyes followed the fate of his army, an impulse
            nigh irresistible came over him to run one short bow-shot to that opposite array, and
            cry in his own Greek tongue:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a Hellene, too! Look on me come to join you, to live and die with you, with my
              face against the Barbarian!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cruel the fate that set him here, impotent, when on that band of countrymen Queen
            Nikē was shedding bright glory! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But he was <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon the Traitor”</span> still, to be awarded the traitor’s doom by
            Leonidas. Therefore the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord Prexaspes”</span> must stand at his post, guarding the king
            of the Aryans. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The second charge was as the first, the third was as the second. Mardonius was full of
            recourses. By repeated attacks he strove to wear the stubborn Hellenes down. The
            Persians proved their courage seven times. Ten of them died gladly, if their deaths
            bought that of a single foe. But few as were Leonidas’s numbers, they were not so few as
            to fail to relieve one another at the front of the press,—which front was fearfully
            narrow. And three times, as his men drifted back in defeat, Xerxes the king <span class="tei tei-q">“leaped
              from the throne whereon he sat, in anguish for his army.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At noon new contingents from the rear took the place of the exhausted attackers. The
            sun beat down with unpitying heat. The wounded lay sweltering in their agony whilst the
            battle roared over them. Mardonius never stopped to count his dead. Then at last came
            nightfall. Man could do no more. As the shadows from Œta grew long over the close scene
            of combat, even the proudest Persians turned away. They had lost thousands. Their defeat
            was absolute. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Before them and to westward and far away
            ranged the jagged mountains, report had it, unthreaded by a single pass. To the eastward
            was only the sea,—the sea closed to them by the Greek fleet at the unseen haven of
            Artemisium. Was the triumph march of the Lord of the World to end in this? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes spoke no word when they took him to his tent that night, a sign of
            indescribable anger. Fear, humiliation, rage—all these seemed driving him mad. His
            chamberlains and eunuchs feared to approach to take off his golden armour. Mardonius
            came to the royal tent; the king, with curses he had never hurled against the bow-bearer
            before, refused to see him. The battle was ended. No one was hardy enough to talk of a
            fresh attack on the morrow. Every captain had to report the loss of scores of his best.
            As Glaucon rode back to Mardonius’s tents, he overheard two infantry officers:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A fearful day—the bow-bearer is likely to pay for it. I hope his Majesty confines
              his anger only to him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—Mardonius will walk the Chinvat bridge to-morrow. The king is turning against
              him. Megabyzus is the bow-bearer’s enemy, and already is gone to his Majesty to say
              that it is Mardonius’s blunders that have brought the army to such a plight. The king
              will catch at that readily.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the tents Glaucon found Artazostra and Roxana. They were both pale. The news of the
            great defeat had been brought by a dozen messengers. Mardonius had not arrived. He was
            not slain, that was certain, but Artazostra feared the worst. The proud daughter of
            Darius found it hard to bear up. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My husband has many enemies. Hitherto the king’s favour has allowed him to mock them.
              But if my brother deserts him, his ruin is speedy. Ah! Ahura-Mazda, why hast Thou
              suffered us to see this day?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon said what he could of comfort, which was little. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Roxana wept piteously; he was fain to soothe her by his caress,—something
            he had never ventured before. Artazostra was on the point of calling her eunuchs and
            setting forth for Xerxes’s tent to plead for the life of her husband, when suddenly
            Pharnuches, Mardonius’s body-servant, came with news that dispelled at least the fears
            of the women. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am bidden to tell your Ladyships that my master has silenced the tongues of his
              enemies and is restored to the king’s good favor. And I am bidden also to command the
              Lord Prexaspes to come to the royal tent. His Majesty has need of him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon went, questioning much as to the service to be required. He did not soon
            forget the scene that followed. The great pavilion was lit by a score of resinous
            flambeaux. The red light shook over the green and purple hangings, the silver plating of
            the tent-poles. At one end rose the golden throne of the king; before it in a semicircle
            the stools of a dozen or more princes and commanders. In the centre stood Mardonius
            questioning a coarse-featured, ill-favoured fellow, who by his sheepskin dress and
            leggings Glaucon instantly recognized as a peasant of this Malian country. The king
            beckoned the Athenian into the midst and was clearly too eager to stand on ceremony. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Greek is better than Mardonius’s, good Prexaspes. In a matter like this we dare
              not trust too many interpreters. This man speaks the rough dialect of his country, and
              few can understand him. Can you interpret?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am passing familiar with the Locrian and Malian dialect, your Majesty.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Question this man further as to what he will do for us. We have understood him but
              lamely.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon proceeded to comply. The man, who was exceeding awkward and ill at ease in
            such august company, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spoke an outrageous shepherd’s
            jargon which even the Athenian understood with effort. But his business came out
            speedily. He was Ephialtes, the son of one Eurydemus, a Malian, a dull-witted grazier of
            the country, brought to Mardonius by hope of reward. The general, partly understanding
            his purpose, had brought him to the king. In brief, he was prepared, for due
            compensation, to lead the Persians by an almost unknown mountain path over the ridge of
            Œta and to the rear of Leonidas’s position at Thermopylæ, where the Hellenes, assailed
            front and rear, would inevitably be destroyed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As Glaucon interpreted, the shout of relieved gladness from the Persian grandees made
            the tent-cloths shake. Xerxes’s eyes kindled. He clapped his hands. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Reward? He shall have ten talents! But where? How?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The man asserted that the path was easy and practicable for a large body of troops. He
            had often been over it with his sheep and goats. If the Persians would start a force at
            once—it was already quite dark—they could fall upon Leonidas at dawn. The Spartan
            would be completely trapped, or forced to open the defile without another spear thrust. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A care, fellow,”</span> warned Mardonius, regarding the man sharply; <span class="tei tei-q">“you speak glibly,
              but if this is a trick to lead a band of the king’s servants to destruction,
              understand you play with deadly dice. If the troops march, you shall have your hands
              knotted together and a soldier walking behind to cut your throat at the first sign of
              treachery.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon interpreted the threat. The man did not wince. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no trap. I will guide you.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That was all they could get him to say. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span>
          <a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And do not the Hellenes know of this mountain path and guard it?”</span> persisted the
            bow-bearer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Ephialtes thought not; at least if they had, they had not told off any efficient
            detachment to guard it. Hydarnes cut the matter short by rising from his stool and
            casting himself before the king. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A boon, your Eternity, a boon!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What is it?”</span> asked the monarch. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Immortals have been disgraced. Twice they have been repulsed with ignominy. The
              shame burns hot in their breasts. Suffer them to redeem their honour. Suffer me to
              take this man and all the infantry of the Life Guard, and at dawn the Lord of the
              World shall see his desire over his miserable enemies.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The words of Hydarnes are good,”</span> added Mardonius, incisively, and Xerxes beamed
            and nodded assent. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Go, scale the mountain with the Immortals and tell this Ephialtes there await him ten
              talents and a girdle of honour if the thing goes well; if ill, let him be flayed alive
              and his skin be made the head of a kettledrum.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stolid peasant did not blench even at this. Glaucon remained in the tent,
            translating and hearing all the details: how Hydarnes was to press the attack from the
            rear at early dawn, how Mardonius was to conduct another onset from the front. At last
            the general of the guard knelt before the king for the last time. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus I go forth, Omnipotence, and to-morrow, behold your will upon your enemies, or
              behold me never more.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I have faithful slaves,”</span> said Xerxes, rising and smiling benignantly upon the
            general and the bow-bearer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us disperse, but first let command be given the
              Magians to cry all night to Mithra and Tishtrya, and to sacrifice to them a white
              horse.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Majesty always enlists the blessings of heaven for your servants,”</span> bowed
            Mardonius, as the company broke up and the king went away to his inner tent and his
            concubines. Glaucon lingered until most of the grandees had gone forth, then the
            bow-bearer went to him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Go back to my tents,”</span> ordered Mardonius; <span class="tei tei-q">“tell Artazostra and Roxana that all is
              well, that Ahura has delivered me from a great strait and restored me to the king’s
              favour, and that to-morrow the gate of Hellas will be opened.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are still bloody and dusty. You have watched all last night and been in the thick
              all day,”</span> expostulated the Athenian; <span class="tei tei-q">“come to the tents with me and rest.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The bow-bearer shook his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No rest until to-morrow, and then the rest of victory or a longer one. Now go; the
              women are consuming with their care.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon wandered back through the long avenues of pavilions. The lights of innumerable
            camp-fires, the hum of thousands of voices, the snorting of horses, the grumbling of
            camels, the groans of men wounded—all these and all other sights and sounds from the
            countless host were lost to him. He walked on by a kind of animal instinct that took him
            to Mardonius’s encampment through the mazes of the canvas city. It was dawning on him
            with a terrible clearness that he was become a traitor to Hellas in very deed. It was
            one thing to be a passive onlooker of a battle, another to be a participant in a plot
            for the ruin of Leonidas. Unless warned betimes the Spartan king and all who followed
            him infallibly would be captured or slaughtered to a man. And he had heard all—the
            traitor, the discussion, the design—had even, if without his choice, been partner and
            helper in the same. The blood of Leonidas and his men would be on his head. Every curse
            the Athenians had heaped on him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>once unjustly, he would
            deserve. Now truly he would be, even in his own mind’s eyes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon the Traitor,
              partner to the betrayal of Thermopylæ.”</span> The doltish peasant, lured by the great
            reward, he might forgive,—himself, the high-born Alcmæonid, never. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> From this revery he was shaken by finding himself at the entrance to the tents of
            Mardonius. Artazostra and Roxana came to meet him. When he told of the deliverance of
            the bow-bearer, he had joy by the light in their eyes. Roxana had never shone in greater
            beauty. He spoke of the heat of the sun, of his throbbing head. The women bathed his
            forehead with lavender-water, touching him with their own soft hands. Roxana sang again
            to him, a low, crooning song of the fragrant Nile, the lotus bells, the nodding palms,
            the perfumed breeze from the desert. Whilst he watched her through half-closed eyes, the
            visions of that day of battles left him. He sat wrapped in a dream world, far from stern
            realities of men and arms. So for a while, as he lounged on the divans, following the
            play of the <a name="corr229" id="corr229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">torch-light</span> on the face of 
            Roxana as her long fingers plied the strings. What
            was it to him if Leonidas fought a losing battle? Was not his happiness secure—be it in
            Hellas, or Egypt, or Bactria? He tried to persuade himself thus. At the end, when he and
            Roxana stood face to face for the parting, he violated all Oriental custom, yet he knew
            her brother would not be angry. He took her in his arms and gave her kiss for kiss. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then he went to his own tent to seek rest. But Hypnos did not come for a long time
            with his poppies. Once out of the Egyptian’s presence the haunting terror had returned,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon the Traitor!”</span> Those three words were always uppermost. At last, indeed,
            sleep came and as he slept he dreamed. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As Glaucon slept he found himself again in Athens. He was on the familiar way from the
            cool wrestling ground of the Academy and walking toward the city through the suburb of
            Ceramicus. Just as he came to the three tall pine trees before the gate, after he had
            passed the tomb of Solon, behold! a fair woman stood in the path and looked on him. She
            was beyond mortal height and of divine beauty, yet a beauty grave and stern. Her gray
            eyes cut to his heart like swords. On her right hand hovered a winged Victory, on her
            shoulder rested an owl, at her feet twined a wise serpent, in her left hand she bore the
            ægis, the shaggy <a name="corr230" id="corr230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">goat-skin</span> engirt 
            with snakes—emblem of Zeus’s lightnings. Glaucon knew
            that she was Athena Polias, the Warder of Athens, and lifted his hands to adore her. But
            she only looked on him in silent anger. Fire seemed leaping from her eyes. The more
            Glaucon besought, the more she turned away. Fear possessed him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe is me,”</span> he
            trembled, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have enraged a terrible immortal.”</span> Then suddenly the woman’s
            countenance was changed. The ægis, the serpent, the Victory, all vanished; he saw
            Hermione before him, beautiful as on the day she ran to greet him at Eleusis, yet sad as
            was his last sight of her the moment he fled from Colonus. Seized with infinite longing,
            he sprang to her. But lo! she drifted back as into the air. It was even as when Odysseus
            followed the shade of his mother in the shadowy Land of the Dead. </p>

            start. Outside the tent sentry was calling to sentry, changing the watch just before the
            dawning. It was perfectly plain to him what he must do. His dream had only given shape
            to the ferment in his brain, a ferment never ceasing while his body slept. He must go
            instantly to the Greek camp and warn Leonidas. If the Spartan did not trust him, no
            matter, he had done his duty. If Leonidas slew him on the spot, again no matter, life
            with an eternally gnawing conscience could be bought on too hard terms. He knew, as
            though Zeus’s messenger Iris had spoken it, that Hermione had never believed him guilty,
            that she had been in all things true to him. He could never betray her trust. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His head now was clear and calm. He arose, threw on his cloak, and buckled about his
            waist a short sword. The Nubian boy that Mardonius had given him for a body-servant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>awoke on his mat, and asked wonderingly <span class="tei tei-q">“whither his
              Lordship was going?”</span> Glaucon informed him he must be at the front before daybreak,
            and bade him remain behind and disturb no one. But the Athenian was not to execute his
            design unhindered. As he passed out of the tent and into the night, where the morning
            stars were burning, and where the first red was creeping upward from the sea, two
            figures glided forth from the next pavilion. He knew them and shrank from them. They
            were Artazostra and Roxana. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You go forth early, dearest Prexaspes,”</span> spoke the Egyptian, throwing back her
            veil, and even in the starlight he saw the anxious flash of her eyes, <span class="tei tei-q">“does the battle
              join so soon that you take so little sleep?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It joins early, lady,”</span> spoke Glaucon, his wits wandering. In the intensity of his
            purpose he had not thought of the partings with the people he must henceforth reckon
            foes. He was sorely beset, when Roxana drew near and laid her hand upon his shoulder. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Greeks will resist terribly,”</span> she spoke. <span class="tei tei-q">“We women dread the battle more
              than you. Yours is the fierce gladness of the combat, ours only the waiting, the heavy
              tidings, the sorrow. Therefore Artazostra and I could not sleep, but have been
              watching together. You will of course be near Mardonius my brother. You will guard him
              from all danger. Leonidas will resist fearfully when at bay. Ah! what is this?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In pressing closer she had discovered the Athenian wore no cuirass. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You will not risk the battle without armour?”</span> was her cry. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not need it, lady,”</span> answered he, and only half conscious what he did,
            stretched forth as if to put her away. Roxana shrank back, grieved and wondering, but
            Artazostra seized his arm quickly. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“What is this, Prexaspes? All is not well. Your manner is strange!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He shook her off, almost savagely. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Call me not Prexaspes,”</span> he cried, not in Persian, but in Greek. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Glaucon of
              Athens; as Glaucon I must live, as Glaucon die. No man—not though he desire it—can
              disown the land that bore him. And if I dreamed I was a Persian, I wake to find myself
              a Greek. Therefore forget me forever. I go to my own!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Prexaspes, my lover,”</span>—Roxana, strong in fear and passion, clung about his girdle,
            while again Artazostra seized him,—<span class="tei tei-q">“last night I was in your arms. Last night you
              kissed me. Are we not to be happy together? What is this you say?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He stood one instant silent, then shook himself and put them both aside with a
            marvellous ease. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Forget my name,”</span> he commanded. <span class="tei tei-q">“If I have given you sorrow, I repent it. I go to
              my own. Go you to yours. My place is with Leonidas—to save him, or more like to die
              with him! Farewell!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He sprang away from them. He saw Roxana sink upon the ground. He heard Artazostra
            calling to the horse-boys and the eunuchs,—perhaps she bade them to pursue. Once he
            looked back, but never twice. He knew the watchwords, and all the sentries let him pass
            by freely. With a feverish stride he traced the avenues of sleeping tents. Soon he was
            at the outposts, where strong divisions of Cissian and Babylonian infantrymen were
            slumbering under arms, ready for the attack the instant the uproar from the rear of the
            pass told how Hydarnes had completed his circuit. Eos—<span class="tei tei-q">“Rosy-Fingered Dawn”</span>—was
            just shimmering above the mist-hung peak of Mt. Telethrius in Eubœa across the bay when
            Glaucon came to the last Persian outpost. The pickets <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>saluted with their lances, as he went by them, taking him for a high officer on a
            reconnoissance before the onset. Next he was on the scene of the former battles. He
            stumbled over riven shields, shattered spear butts, and many times over ghastlier
            objects—objects yielding and still warm—dead men, awaiting the crows of the morrow. He
            walked straight on, while the dawn strengthened and the narrow pass sprang into view,
            betwixt mountain and morass. Then at last a challenge, not in Persian, but in round
            clear Doric. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt! Who passes?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon held up his right hand, and advanced cautiously. Two men in heavy armour
            approached, and threatened his breast with their lance points. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A friend, a Hellene—my speech tells that. Take me to Leonidas. I’ve a story worth
              telling.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euge!</span></span> Master <span class="tei tei-q">‘Friend,’</span> our general can’t be waked for
              every deserter. We’ll call our decarch.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A shout brought the subaltern commanding the Greek outposts. He was a Spartan of less
            sluggish wits than many of his breed, and presently believed Glaucon when he declared he
            had reason in asking for Leonidas. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“But your accent is Athenian?”</span> asked the decarch, with wonderment. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ay, Athenian,”</span> assented Glaucon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Curses on you! I thought no Athenian ever Medized. What business had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> in the Persian camp? Who of your countrymen are there save
              the sons of Hippias?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not many,”</span> rejoined the fugitive, not anxious to have the questions pushed home. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, to Leonidas you shall go, sir Athenian, and state your business. But you are
              like to get a bearish welcome. Since your pretty Glaucon’s treason, our king has not
              wasted much love even on repentant traitors.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With a soldier on either side, the deserter was marched within the barrier wall.
            Another encampment, vastly smaller and less luxurious than the Persian, but of martial
            orderliness, spread out along the pass. The Hellenes were just waking. Some were
            breakfasting from helmets full of cold boiled peas, others buckled on the well-dinted
            bronze cuirasses and greaves. Men stared at Glaucon as he was led by them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A deserter they take to the chief,”</span> ran the whisper, and a little knot of idle
            Spartans trailed behind, when at last Glaucon’s guides halted him before a brown tent
            barely larger than the others. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A man sat on a camp chest by the entrance, and was busy with an iron spoon eating <span class="tei tei-q">“black broth”</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> from a huge kettle. In the dim light Glaucon
            could just see that he wore a purple cloak flung over his black armour, and that the
            helmet resting beside him was girt by a wreath of gold foil. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The two guards dropped their spears in salute. The man looked upward. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A deserter,”</span> reported one of Glaucon’s mentors; <span class="tei tei-q">“he says he has important
            news.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wait!”</span> ordered the general, making the iron spoon clack steadily. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The weal of Hellas rests thereon. Listen!”</span> pleaded the nervous Athenian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wait!”</span> was the unruffled answer, and still the iron spoon went on plying. The
            Spartan lifted a huge morsel from the pot, chewed it deliberately, then put the vessel
            by. Next he inspected the newcomer from head to toe, then at last gave his permission. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Well?”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon’s words were like a bursting torrent. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fly, your Excellency! I’m from Xerxes’s camp. I was at the Persian council. The
              mountain path is betrayed. Hydarnes and the guard are almost over it. They will fall
              upon your rear. Fly, or you and all your men are trapped!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> observed the Spartan, slowly, motioning for the deserter to cease, but
            Glaucon’s fears made that impossible. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I say I was in Xerxes’s own tent. I was interpreter betwixt the king and the traitor.
              I know all whereof I say. If you do not flee instantly, the blood of these men is on
              your head.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Leonidas again scanned the deserter with piercing scrutiny, then flung a question. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The blood leaped into the Athenian’s cheeks. The tongue that had wagged so nimbly
            clove in his mouth. He grew silent. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As the question was repeated, the scrutiny grew yet closer. The soldiers were pressing
            around, one comrade leaning over another’s shoulder. Twenty saw the fugitive’s form
            straighten as he stood in the morning twilight. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> Leonidas’s jaw dropped for an instant. He showed no other astonishment, but
            the listening Spartans raised a yell. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Death! Stone the traitor!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Leonidas, without a word, smote the man nearest to him with a spear butt. The soldiers
            were silent instantly. Then the chief turned back to the deserter. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            than at that crucial moment. Arguments, supplications, protestations of innocence,
            curses upon his unknown enemies, rushed to his lips together. He hardly realized what he
            himself said. Only he knew that at the end the soldiers did not tug at their hilts as
            before and scowl so threateningly, and Leonidas at last lifted his hand as if to bid him
            cease. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The locharchs and taxiarchs of the Greeks assembled. It was a brief and gloomy council
            of war. While Euboulus, commanding the Corinthian contingent, was still questioning
            whether the deserter was worthy of credence, a scout came running down Mt. Œta
            confirming the worst. The cowardly Phocians watching the mountain trail had fled at the
            first arrows of Hydarnes. It was merely a question of time before the Immortals would be
            at Alpeni, the village in Leonidas’s rear. There was only one thing to say, and the
            Spartan chief said it. </p>

            to bid them fly for dear life. Only one or two stayed by the tent, marvelling much to
            observe that Leonidas gave no orders to his Lacedæmonians to join in the flight. On the
            contrary, Glaucon, as he stood near, saw the general lift the discarded pot of broth and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then in the red morning half-light, folding his big hands across his mailed chest,
            Leonidas looked from one to another of the little circle. His voice was still in
            unemotional gutturals when he delivered the longest speech of his life. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We of Sparta were ordered to defend this pass. The order shall be obeyed. The rest of
              you must go away—all save the Thebans, whose loyalty I distrust. Tell Leotychides, my

            Likewise—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A second breathless scout interrupted with the tidings that Hydarnes was on the last
            stretches of his road. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chief arose, drew the helmet
            down across his face, and motioned with his spear. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Go!”</span> he ordered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Corinthian would have seized his hand. He shook him off. At Leonidas’s elbow was
            standing the trumpeter for his three hundred from Lacedæmon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Blow!”</span> commanded the chief. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The keen blast cut the air. The chief deliberately wrapped the purple mantle around
            himself and adjusted the gold circlet over his helmet, for on the day of battle a
            Lacedæmonian was wont to wear his best. And even as he waited there came to him out of
            the midst of the panic-stricken, dissolving camp, one by one, tall men in armour, who
            took station beside him—the men of Sparta who had abided steadfast while all others
            prepared to flee, waiting for the word of the chief. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Presently they stood, a long black line, motionless, silent, whilst the other
            divisions filed in swift fear past. Only the Thespians—let their names not be
            forgotten—chose to share the Laconians’ glory and their doom and took their stand
            behind the line of Leonidas. With them stood also the Thebans, but compulsion held them,
            and they tarried merely to desert and pawn their honour for their lives. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More couriers. Hydarnes’s van was in sight of Alpeni now. The retreat of the
            Corinthians, Tegeans, and other Hellenes became a run; only once Euboulus and his
            fellow-captains turned to the silent warrior that stood leaning on his spear. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you resolved on madness, Leonidas?”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chaire!</span></span> Farewell!”</span> was the only answer he gave them.
            Euboulus sought no more, but faced another figure, hitherto almost forgotten in the
            confusion of the retreat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon did not stir. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not see that it is impossible?”</span> he answered, then strode across to

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you also mad? You are young—”</span> The good-hearted Corinthian strove to drag him
            into the retreating mob. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon sprang away from him and addressed the silent general. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall not Athens remain by Sparta, if Sparta will accept?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He could see Leonidas’s cold eyes gleam out through the slits in his helmet. The
            general reached forth his hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparta accepts,”</span> called he; <span class="tei tei-q">“they have lied concerning your Medizing! And you,
              Euboulus, do not filch from him his glory.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus pity you!”</span> cried Euboulus, running at last. One of the Spartans brought to
            Glaucon the heavy hoplite’s armour and the ponderous spear and shield. He took his place
            in the line with the others. Leonidas stalked to the right wing of his scant array, the
            post of honour and of danger. The Thespians closed up behind. Shield was set to shield.
            Helmets were drawn low. The lance points projected in a bristling hedge in front. All
            was ready. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The general made no speech to fire his men. There was no wailing, no crying to the
            gods, no curses upon the tardy ephors at Lacedæmon who had deferred sending their whole
            strong levy instead of the pitiful three hundred. Sparta had sent this band to hold the
            pass. They had gone, knowing she might require the supreme sacrifice. Leonidas had
            spoken for all his men. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparta demanded it.”</span> What more was to be said? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As for Glaucon he could think of nothing save—in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>language of his people—<span class="tei tei-q">“this was a beautiful manner and place in which to die.”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Count no man happy until he meets a happy end,”</span> so had said Solon, and of all ends
            what could be more fortunate than this? Euboulus would tell in Athens, in all Hellas,
            how he had remained with Leonidas and maintained Athenian honour when Corinthian and
            Tegean turned away. From <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon the Traitor”</span> he would be raised to <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon the
              Hero.”</span> Hermione, Democrates, and all others he loved would flush with pride and no
            more with shame when men spoke of him. Could a life of a hundred years add to his glory
            more than he could win this day? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Blow!”</span> commanded Leonidas again, and again pealed the trumpet. The line moved
            beyond the wall toward Xerxes’s camp in the open beside the Asopus. Why wait for
            Hydarnes’s coming? They would meet the king of the Aryans face to face and show him the
            terrible manner in which the men of Lacedæmon knew how to die. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As they passed from the shadow of the mountain, the sun sprang over the hills of
            Eubœa, making fire of the bay and bathing earth and heavens with glory. In their rear
            was already shouting. Hydarnes had reached his goal at Alpeni. All retreat was ended.
            The thin line swept onward. Before them spread the whole host of the Barbarian as far as
            the eye could reach,—a tossing sea of golden shields, scarlet surcoats, silver
            lance-heads,—awaiting with its human billows to engulf them. The Laconians halted just
            beyond bow shot. The line locked tighter. Instinctively every man pressed closer to his
            comrade. Then before the eyes of Xerxes’s host, which kept silence, marvelling, the
            handful broke forth with their pæan. They threw their well-loved charging song of
            Tyrtæus in the very face of the king. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ugh—the dogs died hard, but they are dead,”</span> grunted Xerxes, still shivering on
            the ivory throne. The battle had raged disagreeably close to him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They are dead; even so perish all of your Eternity’s enemies,”</span> rejoined Mardonius,
            close by. The bow-bearer himself was covered with blood and dust. A Spartan sword had
            grazed his forehead. He had exposed himself recklessly, as well he might, for it had
            taken all the efforts of the Persian captains, as well as the ruthless laying of whips
            over the backs of their men, to make the king’s battalions face the frenzied Hellenes,
            until the closing in of Hydarnes from the rear gave the battle its inevitable ending. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes was victorious. The gate of Hellas was unlocked. The mountain wall of Œta would
            hinder him no more. But the triumph had been bought with a price which made Mardonius
            and every other general in the king’s host shake his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord,”</span> reported Hystaspes, commander of the Scythians, <span class="tei tei-q">“one man in every seven

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the heaviest news no man save Mardonius dared to bring to the king. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“May it please your Omnipotence,”</span> spoke the bow-bearer, <span class="tei tei-q">“to order the funeral
              pyres of cedar and precious oils to be prepared for your brothers Abrocomes and
              Hyperanthes, and command the Magians to offer prayers for the repose of their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fravashis</span></span> in Garonmana the Blessed, for it pleased Mazda the
              Great they should fall before the Hellenes.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes waved his hand in assent. It was hard to be the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the World,”</span> and
            be troubled by such little things as the deaths of a few thousand servants, or even of
            two of his numerous half-brethren, hard at least on a day like this when he had seen his
            desire over his enemies. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall be well avenged,”</span> he announced with kingly dignity, then smiled with
            satisfaction when they brought him the shield and helmet of Leonidas, the madman, who
            had dared to contemn his power. But all the generals who stood by were grim and sad. One
            more such victory would bring the army close to destruction. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Xerxes’s happiness, however, was not to be clouded. From childish fears he had passed
            to childish exultation. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Have you found the body also of this crazed Spartan?”</span> he inquired of the cavalry
            officer who had brought the trophies. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“As you say, Omnipotence,”</span> rejoined the captain, bowing in the saddle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Good, then. Let the head be struck off and the trunk fastened on a cross that all may
              see it. And you, Mardonius,”</span> addressing the bow-bearer, <span class="tei tei-q">“ride back to the hillock
              where these madmen made their last stand. If you discover among the corpses any who
              yet breathe, bring them hither <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to me, that they may
              learn the futility of resisting my might.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The bow-bearer shrugged his shoulders. He loved a fair battle and fair treatment of
            valiant foes. The dishonouring of the corpse of Leonidas was displeasing to more than
            one high-minded Aryan nobleman. But the king had spoken, and was to be obeyed. Mardonius
            rode back to the hillock at the mouth of the pass, where the Hellenes had retired—after
            their spears were broken and they could resist only with swords, stones, or naked
            hands—for the final death grip. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The slain Barbarians lay in heaps. The Greeks had been crushed at the end, not in
            close strife, but by showers of arrows. Mardonius dismounted and went with a few
            followers among the dead. Plunderers were already at their harpy work of stripping the
            slain. The bow-bearer chased them angrily away. He oversaw the task which his attendants
            performed as quickly as possible. Their toil was not quite fruitless. Three or four
            Thespians were still breathing, a few more of the helots who had attended Leonidas’s
            Spartans, but not one of the three hundred but seemed dead, and that too with many
            wounds. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Snofru, Mardonius’s Egyptian body-servant, rose from the ghastly work and grinned with
            his ivories at his master. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Snofru and his helpers resumed their toil. Presently the Egyptian dragged from a
            bloody heap a body, and raised a yell. <span class="tei tei-q">“Another one—he breathes!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There’s life in him. He shall not be left to the crows. Take him forth and lay him

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was not easy to roll the three corpses from their feebly stirring comrade. When
            this was done, the stricken man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was still encased in
            his cuirass and helmet. They saw only that his hands were slim and white. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“With care,”</span> ordered the humane bow-bearer, <span class="tei tei-q">“he is a young man. I heard Leonidas
              took only older men on his desperate venture. Here, rascals, do you not see he is
              smothered in that helmet? Lift him up, unbuckle the cuirass. By Mithra, he has a
              strong and noble form! Now the helmet—uncover the face.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But as the Egyptian did so, his master uttered a shout of mingled wonderment and
            terror. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon—Prexaspes, and in Spartan armour!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What had befallen Glaucon was in no wise miraculous. He had borne his part in the
            battle until the Hellenes fell back to the fatal hillock. Then in one of the fierce
            onsets which the Barbarians attempted before they had recourse to the simpler and less
            glorious method of crushing their foes by arrow fire, a Babylonian’s war club had dashed
            upon his helmet. The stout bronze had saved him from wound, but under the stroke
            strength and consciousness had left him in a flash. The moment after he fell, the
            soldier beside him had perished by a javelin, and falling above the Athenian made his
            body a ghastly shield against the surge and trampling of the battle. Glaucon lay
            scathless but senseless through the final catastrophe. Now consciousness was returning,
            but he would have died of suffocation save for Snofru’s timely aid. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was well for the Athenian that Mardonius was a man of ready devices. He had not
            seen Glaucon at his familiar post beside the king, but had presumed the Hellene had
            remained at the tents with the women, unwilling to watch the destruction of his people.
            In the rush and roar of the battle the messenger Artazostra had sent her husband telling
            of <span class="tei tei-q">“Prexaspes’s”</span> flight had never reached him. But Mar<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>donius could divine what had happened. The swallow must fly south in the
            autumn. The Athenian had returned to his own. The bow-bearer’s wrath at his protégé’s
            desertion was overmastered by the consuming fear that tidings of Prexaspes’s disloyalty
            would get to the king. Xerxes’s wrath would be boundless. Had he not proffered his new
            subject all the good things of his empire? And to be rewarded thus! Glaucon’s recompense
            would be to be sawn asunder or flung into a serpent’s cage. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Fortunately Mardonius had only his own personal followers around him. He could count
            on their discreet loyalty. Vouchsafing no explanations, but bidding them say not a word
            of their discovery on their heads, he ordered Snofru and his companions to make a litter
            of cloaks and lances, to throw away Glaucon’s tell-tale Spartan armour, and bear him
            speedily to Artazostra’s tents. The stricken man was groaning feebly, moving his limbs,
            muttering incoherently. The sight of Xerxes driving in person to inspect the
            battle-field made Mardonius hasten the litter away, while he remained to parley with the
            king. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“So only a few are alive?”</span> asked Xerxes, leaning over the silver rail of the
            chariot, and peering on the upturned faces of the dead which were nearly trampled by his
            horses. <span class="tei tei-q">“Are any sound enough to set before me?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“None, your Eternity; even the handful that live are desperately wounded. We have laid
              them yonder.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let them wait, then; all around here seem dead. Ugly hounds!”</span> muttered the
            monarch, still peering down; <span class="tei tei-q">“even in death they seem to grit their teeth and defy me.
              Faugh! The stench is already terrible. It is just as well they are dead. Angra-Mainyu
              surely possessed them to fight so! It cannot be there are many more who can fight like
              this left in Hellas, though Demaratus, the Spartan outlaw, says <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there are. Drive away, Pitiramphes—and you, Mardonius, ride beside me.
              I cannot abide those corpses. Where is my handkerchief? The one with the Sabæan nard
              on it. I will hold it to my nose. Most refreshing! And I had a question to ask—I have
              forgotten what.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether news has come from the fleets before Artemisium?”</span> spoke Mardonius,
            galloping close to the wheel. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not that. Ah! I remember. Where was Prexaspes? I did not see him near me. Did he stay
              in the tents while these mad men were destroyed? It was not loyal, yet I forgive him.
              After all, he was once a Hellene.”</span>
          </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“May it please your Eternity,”</span>—Mardonius chose his words carefully,—a Persian
            always loved the truth, and lies to the king were doubly impious,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Prexaspes was not
              in the tents but in the thick of the battle.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> Xerxes smiled pleasantly, <span class="tei tei-q">“it was right loyal of him to show his devotion
              to me thus. And he acquitted himself valiantly?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Most valiantly, Omnipotence.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Doubly good. Yet he ought to have stayed near me. If he had been a true Persian, he

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I regret to tell your Eternity he was desperately wounded, though your servant hopes

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Where that pretty dancer, your sister, will play the surgeon—ha!”</span> cried the king.
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, tell him his Lord is grateful. He shall not be forgotten. If his wounds do
              not mend, call in my body-physicians. And I will send him something in gratitude—a

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A general rode up to the chariot with his report, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mardonius was suffered to gallop to his own tents, blessing Mazda; he had saved the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ever ready eunuchs of Artazostra ran to tell Mardonius of the Hellene’s strange
            desertion, even before their lord dismounted. Mardonius was not astonished now, however
            much the tidings pained him. The Greek had escaped more than trifling wounds; ten days
            would see him sound and hale, but the stunning blow had left his wits still wandering.
            He had believed himself dead at first, and demanded why Charon took so long with his
            ferry-boat. He had not recognized Roxana, but spoke one name many times—<span class="tei tei-q">“Hermione!”</span> And the Egyptian, understanding too well, went to her own tent weeping
            bitterly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He has forsaken us,”</span> spoke Artazostra, harshly, to her husband. <span class="tei tei-q">“He has paid
              kindness with disloyalty. He has chosen the lot of his desperate race rather than
              princely state amongst the Aryans. Your sister is in agony.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And I with her,”</span> returned the bow-bearer, gravely, <span class="tei tei-q">“but let us not forget one
              thing—this man has saved our lives. And all else weighs small in the balance.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When Mardonius went to him, Glaucon was again himself. He lay on bright pillows, his
            forehead swathed in linen. His eyes were unnaturally bright. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You know what has befallen?”</span> asked Mardonius. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They have told me. I almost alone of all the Hellenes have not been called to the
              heroes’ Elysium, to the glory of Theseus and Achilles, the glory that shall not die.
              Yet I am content. For plainly the Olympians have destined that I should see and do
              great things in Hellas, otherwise they would not have kept me back from Leonidas’s
              glory.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Athenian’s voice rang confidently. None of the halting weakness remained that had

            <span class="tei tei-q">“And wherefore are you grown so bold?”</span> The bow-bearer was troubled as he looked on

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, yes! divinely mad.”</span> Brighter still grew the Athenian’s eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">“For that

            <span class="tei tei-q">“No, Mardonius, good friend, for do not think that we must be foes one to another
              because our people are at war,—I can answer you with ease. Leonidas you have slain,
              and his handful, and you have pierced the mountain wall of Œta, and no doubt your
              king’s host will march even to Athens. But do not dream Hellas is conquered by
              striding over her land. Before you shall possess the land you must first possess the
              men. And I say to you, Athens is still left, and Sparta left, free and strong, with
              men whose hearts and hands can never fail. I doubted once. But now I doubt no more.
              And our gods will fight for us. Your Ahura-Mazda has still to prevail over Zeus the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And you?”</span> asked the Persian. </p>

            go theirs, unless he were to be handed over to Xerxes to die a death of torments. And

            tinkle of the goat bells upon the rocks, the laugh of little children in the
            streets—all these made Athens fair, but could not take the cloud from the hearts of the
            people. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Trade was at standstill in the Agora. The most careless frequented the temples. Old
            foes composed their cases before the arbitrator. The courts were closed, but there was
            meeting after meeting in the Pnyx, with incessant speeches on one theme—how Athens must
            resist to the bitter end. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And why should not the end be bitter? Argos and Crete had Medized. Corcyra promised
            and did nothing. Thebes was weakening. Thessaly had sent earth and water. Corinth,
            Ægina, and a few lesser states were moderately loyal, but great Sparta only
            procrastinated and despatched no help <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to her Athenian
            ally. So every day the Persian thunder-cloud was darkening. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But one man never faltered, nor suffered others about him to falter,—Themistocles.
            The people heard him gladly—he would never talk of defeat. He had a thousand reasons
            why the invader should be baffled, from a convenient hexameter in old Bacis’s oracle
            book, up to the fact that the Greeks used the longest spears. If he found it weary work
            looking the crowding peril in the face and smiling still, he never confessed it. His
            friends would marvel at his serenity. Only when they saw him sit silent, saw his brows
            knit, his hand comb at his beard, they knew his inexhaustible brain was weaving the web
            which should ensnare the lord of the Aryans. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus day after day—while men thought dark things in their hearts. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermippus had come down to his city house from Eleusis, and with him his wife and
            daughter. The Eleusinian was very busy. He was a member of the Areopagus, the old
            council of ex-archons, an experienced body that found much to do. Hermippus had strained
            his own resources to provide shields for the hoplites. He was constantly with
            Themistocles, which implied being much with Democrates. The more he saw of the young
            orator, the better the Eleusinian liked him. True, not every story ran to Democrates’s
            credit, but Hermippus knew the world, and could forgive a young man if he had
            occasionally spent a jolly night. Democrates seemed to have forsworn Ionian harp-girls
            now. His patriotism was self-evident. The Eleusinian saw in him a most desirable
            protector in the perils of war for Hermione and her child. Hermione’s dislike for her
            husband’s destroyer was natural,—nay, in bounds, laudable,—but one must not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>give way too much to women’s phantasies. The lady was
            making a Cyclops of Democrates by sheer imagination; an interview would dispel her
            prejudices. Therefore Hermippus planned, and his plan was not hard to execute. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the day the fleet sailed to Artemisium, Hermione went with her mother to the
            havens, as all the city went, to wish godspeed to the <span class="tei tei-q">“wooden wall”</span> of Hellas. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> One hundred and twenty-seven triremes were to go forth, and three and fifty to follow,
            bearing the best and bravest of Athens with them. Themistocles was in absolute command,
            and perhaps in his heart of hearts Democrates was not mournful if it lay out of his
            power to do a second ill-turn to his country. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was again summer, and again such a day as when Glaucon with glad friends had rowed
            toward Salamis. The Saronian bay flashed fairest azure. The scattered isles and the
            headlands of Argolis rose in clear beauty. The city had emptied itself. Mothers hung on
            the necks of sons as the latter strode toward Peiræus; friends clasped hands for the
            last time as he who remained promised him who went that the wife and little ones should
            never be forgotten. Only Hermione, as she stood on the hill of Munychia above the triple
            havens, shed no tear. The ship bearing her all was gone long since. Themistocles would
            never lead it back. Hermippus was at the quay in Peiræus, taking leave of the admiral.
            Old Cleopis held the babe as Hermione stood by her mother. The younger woman had
            suffered her gaze to wander to far Ægina, where a featherlike cloud hung above the
            topmost summit of the isle, when her mother’s voice called her back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They go.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A line of streamers blew from the foremast of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> as
            the piper on the flag-ship gave the time to the oars. The triple line of blades, pumiced
            white, splashed with a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>steady rhythm. The long black
            hull glided away. The trailing line of consorts swiftly followed. From the hill and the
            quays a shout uprose from the thousands, to be answered by the fleet,—a cheer or a
            prayer to sea-ruling Poseidon those who gave it hardly knew. The people stood silent
            till the last dark hull crept around the southern headland; then, still in silence, the
            multitudes dissolved. The young and the strong had gone from them. For Athens this was
            the beginning of the war. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione and Lysistra awaited Hermippus before setting homeward, but the Eleusinian
            was delayed. The fleet had vanished. The havens were empty. In Cleopis’s arms little
            Phœnix wept. His mother was anxious to be gone, when she was surprised to see a figure
            climbing the almost deserted slope. A moment more and she was face to face with
            Democrates, who advanced outstretching his hand and smiling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The orator wore the dress of his new office of strategus. The purple-edged cloak, the
            light helmet wreathed with myrtle, the short sword at his side, all became him well. If
            there were deeper lines about his face than on the day Hermione last saw him, even an
            enemy would confess a leader of the Athenians had cause to be thoughtful. He was
            cordially greeted by Lysistra and seemed not at all abashed that Hermione gave only a
            sullen nod. From the ladies he turned with laughter to Cleopis and her burden. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A new Athenian!”</span> spoke he, lightly, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I fear Xerxes will have been chased
              away before he has a chance to prove his valour. But fear not, there will be more
              brave days in store.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione shook her head, ill-pleased. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be Hera, my babe is too young to know aught of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wars. And if we survive this one, will not just Zeus spare us from
              further bloodshed?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates, without answering, approached the nurse, and Phœnix—for reasons best
            known to himself—ceased lamenting and smiled up in the orator’s face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“His mother’s features and eyes,”</span> cried Democrates. <span class="tei tei-q">“I swear it—ay, by all
              Athena’s owls—that young Hermes when he lay in Maia’s cave on Mt. Cylene was not
              finer or lustier than he. His mother’s face and eyes, I say.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“His father’s,”</span> corrected Hermione. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not his name Phœnix? In him will not
              Glaucon the Beautiful live again? Will he not grow to man’s estate to avenge his
              murdered father?”</span> The lady spoke without passion, but with a cold bitterness that
            made Democrates cease from smiling. He turned away from the babe. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Forgive me, dear lady,”</span> he answered her, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am wiser at ruling the Athenians
              than at ruling children, but I see nothing of Glaucon about the babe, though much of
              his beautiful mother.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You had once a better memory, Democrates,”</span> said Hermione, reproachfully. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not understand your Ladyship.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I mean that Glaucon has been dead one brief year. Can you forget <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span> face in so short a while?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But here Lysistra interposed with all good intent. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are fond and foolish, Hermione, and like all young mothers are enraged if all the
              world does not see his father’s image in their first-born.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Democrates knows what I would say,”</span> said the younger woman, soberly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Since your Ladyship is pleased to speak in riddles and I am no seer nor

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Her only joy,”</span> was Hermione’s icy answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wrap up the child, Cleopis. My father
              is coming. It is a long walk home to the city.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With a rustle of white Hermione went down the slope in advance of her mother.
            Hermippus and Lysistra were not pleased. Plainly their daughter kept all her prejudice
            against Democrates. Her cold contempt was more disappointing even than open fury. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Once at home Hermione held little Phœnix long to her heart and wept over him. For the
            sake of her dead husband’s child, if for naught else, how could she suffer them to give
            her to Democrates? That the orator had destroyed Glaucon in black malice had become a
            corner-stone in her belief. She could at first give for it only a woman’s reason—blind
            intuition. She could not discuss her conviction with her mother or with any save a
            strange confidant—Phormio. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She had met the fishmonger in the Agora once when she went with the slaves to buy a
            mackerel. The auctioneer had astonished everybody by knocking down to her a noble fish
            an obol under price, then under pretext of showing her a rare Bœotian eel got her aside
            into his booth and whispered a few words that made the red and white come and go from
            her cheeks, after which the lady’s hand went quickly to her purse, and she spoke quick
            words about <span class="tei tei-q">“the evening”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the garden gate.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Phormio refused the drachma brusquely, but kept the tryst. Cleopis had the key to the
            garden, and would contrive anything for her mistress—especially as all Athens knew
            Phormio was harmless save with his tongue. That evening for the first time Hermione
            heard the true story of Glaucon’s escape by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Solon</span></span>, but when
            the fishmonger paused she hung down her head closer. </p>

            met only slaves and graybeards. In the Agora the hucksters’ booths were silent, but
            little groups of white-headed men sat in the shaded porticos and watched eagerly for the
            appearing of the archon before the government house to read the last despatch of the
            progress of Xerxes. The Pnyx was deserted. The gymnasia were closed. The more
            superstitious scanned the heavens for a lucky or unlucky flight of hawks. The priest<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>esses sang litanies all day and all night on the
            Acropolis where the great altar to Athena smoked with victims continually. At last,
            after the days of uncertainty and wavering rumour, came surer tidings of battles. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Leonidas is fighting at Thermopylæ. The fleets are fighting at Artemisium, off Eubœa.
              The first onsets of the Barbarians have failed, but nothing is decided.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This was the substance, and tantalizingly meagre. And the strong army of Sparta and
            her allies still tarried at the Isthmus instead of hasting to aid the pitiful handful at
            Thermopylæ. Therefore the old men wagged their heads, the altars were loaded with
            victims, and the women wept over their children. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So ended the first day after news came of the fighting. The second was like it—only
            more tense. Hermione never knew that snail called time to creep more slowly. Never had
            she chafed more against the iron custom which commanded Athenian gentlewomen to keep,
            tortoise-like, at home in days of distress and tumult. On the evening of the second day
            came once more the dusty courier. Leonidas was holding the gate of Hellas. The
            Barbarians had perished by thousands. At Artemisium, Themistocles and the allied Greek
            admirals were making head against the Persian armadas. But still nothing was decided.
            Still the Spartan host lingered at the Isthmus, and Leonidas must fight his battle
            alone. The sun sank that night with tens of thousands wishing his car might stand fast.
            At gray dawn Athens was awake and watching. Men forgot to eat, forgot to drink. One food
            would have contented—news! </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was about noon—<span class="tei tei-q">“the end of market time,”</span> had there been any market then at
            Athens—when Hermione knew by instinct that news had come from the battle and that it
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was evil. She and her mother had sat since dawn by
            the upper window, craning forth their heads up the street toward the Agora, where they
            knew all couriers must hasten. Along the street in all the houses other women were
            peering forth also. When little Phœnix cried in his cradle, his mother for the first
            time in his life almost angrily bade him be silent. Cleopis, the only one of the
            fluttering servants who went placidly about the wonted tasks, vainly coaxed her young
            mistress with figs and a little wine. Hermippus was at the council. The street, save for
            the leaning heads of the women, was deserted. Then suddenly came a change. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> First a man ran toward the Agora, panting,—his himation blew from his shoulders, he
            never stopped to recover it. Next shouts, scattered in the beginning, then louder, and
            coming not as a roar but as a wailing, rising, falling like the billows of the howling
            sea,—as if the thousands in the market-place groaned in sore agony. Shrill and hideous
            they rose, and a hand of ice fell on the hearts of the listening women. Then more
            runners, until the street seemed alive by magic, slaves and old men all crowding to the
            Agora. And still the shout and ever more dreadful. The women leaned from the windows and
            cried vainly to the trampling crowd below. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell us! In the name of Athena, tell us!”</span> No answer for long, till at last a
            runner came not toward the Agora but from it. They had hardly need to hear what he was
            calling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Leonidas is slain. Thermopylæ is turned! Xerxes is advancing!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione staggered back from the lattice. In the cradle Phœnix awoke; seeing his
            mother bending over him, he crowed cheerily and flung his chubby fists in her face. She
            caught him up and again could not fight the tears away. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span>
          <a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon! Glaucon!”</span> she prayed,—for her husband was all but a deity in her
              sight,—<span class="tei tei-q">“hear us wherever you are, even if in the blessed land of Rhadamanthus. Take
              us thither, your child and me, for there is no peace or shelter left on earth!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then, seeing her panic-stricken women flying hither and thither like witless birds,
            her patrician blood asserted itself. She dashed the drops from her eyes and joined her
            mother in quieting the maids. Whatever there was to hope or fear, their fate would not
            be lightened by wild moaning. Soon the direful wailing from the Agora ceased. A blue
            flag waved over the Council House, a sign that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Five Hundred”</span> had been called
            in hurried session. Simultaneously a dense column of smoke leaped up from the
            market-place. The archons had ordered the hucksters’ booths to be burned, as a signal to
            all Attica that the worst had befallen. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After inexpressibly long waiting Phormio came, then Hermippus, to tell all they knew.
            Leonidas had perished gloriously. His name was with the immortals, but the mountain wall
            of Hellas had been unlocked. No Spartan army was in Bœotia. The bravest of Athens were
            in the fleet. The easy Attic passes of Phyle and Decelea could never be defended.
            Nothing could save Athens from Xerxes. The calamity had been foreseen, but to foresee is
            not to realize. That night in Athens no man slept. </p>

            dared not face. The Barbarian was within five days’ march of Attica. The Athenians must
            bow the knee to the world monarch or go forth exiles from their country. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the morning after the night of terror came another courier, not this time from
            Thermopylæ. He bore a letter from Themistocles, who was returning from Eubœa with the
            whole allied Grecian fleet. The reading of the letter in the Agora was the first rift in
            the cloud above the city. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was no time for an assembly at the Pnyx, but the Five Hundred and the Areopagus
            council acted for the people. It was ordered to remove the entire population of Attica,
            with all their movable goods, across the bay to Salamis or to the friendly Peloponnesus,
            and that same noon the heralds went over the land to bear the direful summons. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To Hermione, who in the calm after-years looked back on all this year of agony and
            stress as on an unreal thing, one time always was stamped on memory as no dream, but
            vivid, unforgetable,—these days of the great evacuation. Up and down the pleasant plain
            country of the Mesogia to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>southward, to the rolling
            highlands beyond Pentelicus and Parnes, to the slumbering villages by Marathon, to the
            fertile farm-land by Eleusis, went the proclaimers of ill-tidings. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Quit your homes, hasten to Athens, take with you what you can, but hasten, or stay as
              Xerxes’s slaves.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For the next two days a piteous multitude was passing through the city. A country of
            four hundred thousand inhabitants was to be swept clean and left naked and profitless to
            the invader. Under Hermione’s window, as she gazed up and down the street, jostled the
            army of fugitives, women old and young, shrinking from the bustle and uproar, grandsires
            on their staves, boys driving the bleating goats or the patient donkeys piled high with
            pots and panniers, little girls tearfully hugging a pet puppy or hen. But few strong men
            were seen, for the fleet had not yet rounded Sunium to bear the people away. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The well-loved villas and farmsteads were tenantless. They left the standing grain,
            the ripening orchards, the groves of the sacred olives. Men rushed for the last time to
            the shrines where their fathers had prayed,—the temples of Theseus, Olympian Zeus,
            Dionysus, Aphrodite. The tombs of the worthies of old, stretching out along the Sacred
            Way to Eleusis, where Solon, Clisthenes, Miltiades, and many another bulwark of Athens
            slept, had the last votive wreath hung lovingly upon them. And especially men sought the
            great temple of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Rock,”</span> to lift their hands to Athena Polias, and vow awful
            vows of how harm to the Virgin Goddess should be wiped away in blood. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So the throng passed through the city and toward the shore, awaiting the fleet. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It came after eager watching. The whole fighting force of Athens and her Corinthian,
            Æginetan, and other allies. Before the rest raced a stately ship, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>, her triple-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>oar bank flying faster
            than the spray. The people crowded to the water’s edge when the great trireme cast off
            her pinnace and a well-known figure stepped therein. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Themistocles is with us!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He landed at Phaleron, the thousands greeted him as if he were a god. He seemed their
            only hope—the Atlas upbearing all the fates of Athens. With the glance of his eye, with
            a few quick words, he chased the terrors from the strategi and archons that crowded up
            around him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Why distressed? Have we not held the Barbarians back nobly at Artemisium? Will we not
              soon sweep his power from the seas in fair battle?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With almost a conqueror’s train he swept up to the city. A last assembly filled the
            Pnyx. Themistocles had never been more hopeful, more eloquent. With one voice men voted
            never to bend the knee to the king. If the gods forbade them to win back their own dear
            country, they would go together to Italy, to found a new and better Athens far from the
            Persian’s power. And at Themistocles’s motion they voted to recall all the political
            exiles, especially Themistocles’s own great enemy Aristeides the Just, banished by the
            son of Neocles only a few years before. The assembly dispersed—not weeping but with
            cheers. Already it was time to be quitting the city. Couriers told how the Tartar
            horsemen were burning the villages beyond Parnes. The magistrates and admirals went to
            the house of Athena. The last incense smoked before the image. The bucklers hanging on
            the temple wall were taken down by Cimon and the other young patricians. The statue was
            reverently lifted, wound in fine linen, and borne swiftly to the fleet. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">makaira</span></span>!”</span> called Hermippus, entering his house to
            summon his daughter. Hermione sent a last glance around the disordered aula; her mother
            called to the bevy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of pallid, whimpering maids. Cleopis
            was bearing Phœnix, but Hermione took him from her. Only his own mother should bear him
            now. They went through the thinning Agora and took one hard look at each familiar
            building and temple. When they should return to them, the inscrutable god kept hid. So
            to Peiræus,—and to the rapid pinnaces which bore them across the narrow sea to Salamis,
            where for the moment at least was peace. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All that day the boats were bearing the people, and late into the night, until the
            task was accomplished, the like whereof is not found in history. No Athenian who willed
            was left to the power of Xerxes. One brain and voice planned and directed all. Leonidas,
            Ajax of the Hellenes, had been taken. Themistocles, their Odysseus, valiant as Ajax and
            gifted with the craft of the immortals, remained. Could that craft and that valour turn
            back the might of even the god-king of the Aryans? </p>

            common report, to Apollo himself, who broke off two mountain crags to crush the impious
            invaders. But no such miracle halted the march on Athens. Bœotia and her cities welcomed
            the king; Thespiæ and Platæa, which had stood fast for Hellas, were burned. The
            Peloponnesian army lingered at Corinth, busy with a wall across the Isthmus, instead of
            risking valorous battle. </p>

            Laconian helmet. He was able to walk, and, if need be, ride, but Mardonius would not
            suffer him to go outside his own tents. The Athenian would be certain to be recognized,
            and at once Xerxes would send for him, and how Glaucon, in his new frame of mind, would
            deport himself before majesty, whether he would not taunt the irascible monarch to his
            face, the bow-bearer did not know. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Therefore the
            Athenian endured a manner of captivity in the tents with the eunuchs, pages, and women.
            Artazostra was often with him, and less frequently Roxana. But the Egyptian had lost all
            power over him now. He treated her with a cold courtesy more painful than contempt. Once
            or twice Artazostra had tried to turn him back from his purpose, but her words always
            broke themselves over one barrier. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am born a Hellene, lady. My gods are not yours. I must live and die after the
              manner of my people. And that our gods are strong and will give victory, after that
              morning with Leonidas I dare not doubt.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When the host advanced south and eastward from Thermopylæ, Glaucon went with it,
            riding in a closed travelling carriage guarded by Mardonius’s eunuchs. All who saw it
            said that here went one of the bow-bearer’s harem women, and as for the king, every day
            he asked for his favourite, and every day Mardonius told him, <span class="tei tei-q">“He is even as
            before,”</span> an answer which the bow-bearer prayed to truth-loving Mithra might not be
            accounted a lie. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was while the army lay at Platæa that news came which might have shaken Glaucon’s
            purpose, had that purpose been shakable. Euboulus the Corinthian had been slain in a
            skirmish shortly after the forcing of Thermopylæ. The tidings meant that no one lived
            who could tell in Athens that on the day of testing the outlaw had cast in his lot with
            Hellas. Leonidas was dead. The Spartan soldiers who had heard Glaucon avow his identity
            were dead. In the hurried conference of captains preceding the retreat, Leonidas had
            told his informant’s precise name only to Euboulus. And now Euboulus was slain,
            doubtless before any word from him of Glaucon’s deed could spread abroad. To Athenians
            Glaucon was still the <span class="tei tei-q">“Traitor,”</span> doubly execrated in this hour of trial. If he
            returned to his people, would he not be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>torn in pieces
            by the mob? But the young Alcmæonid was resolved. Since he had not died at Thermopylæ,
            no life in the camp of the Barbarian was tolerable. He would trust sovran Athena who had
            plucked him out of one death to deliver from a second. Therefore he nursed his
            strength—a caged lion waiting for freedom,—and almost wished the Persian host would
            advance more swiftly that he might haste onward to his own. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon had cherished a hope to see the whole power of the Peloponnesus in array in
            Bœotia, but that hope proved quickly vain. The oracle was truly to be fulfilled,—the
            whole of <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of Cecrops”</span> was to be possessed by the Barbarian. The mountain
            passes were open. No arrows greeted the Persian vanguard as it cantered down the
            defiles, and once more the king’s courtiers told their smiling master that not another
            hand would be raised against him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fourth month after quitting the Hellespont Xerxes entered Athens. The gates stood
            ajar. The invaders walked in silent streets as of a city of the dead. A few runaway
            slaves alone greeted them. Only in the Acropolis a handful of superstitious old men and
            temple warders had barricaded themselves, trusting that Athena would still defend her
            holy mountain. For a few days they defended the steep, rolling down huge boulders, but
            the end was inevitable. The Persians discovered a secret path upward. The defenders were
            surprised and dashed themselves from the crags or were massacred. A Median spear-man
            flung a fire-brand. The house of the guardian goddess went up in flame. The red column
            leaping to heaven was a beacon for leagues around that Xerxes held the length and
            breadth of Attica. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon watched the burning temple with grinding teeth. Mardonius’s tents were pitched
            in the eastern city by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fountain of Callirhoë,—a
            spot of fond memories for the Alcmæonid. Here first he had met Hermione, come with her
            maids to draw water, and had gone away dreaming of Aphrodite arising from the sea. Often
            here he had sat with Democrates by the little pool, whilst the cypresses above talked
            their sweet, monotonous music. Before him rose the Rock of Athena,—the same, yet not
            the same. The temple of his fathers was vanishing in smoke and ashes. What wonder that
            he turned to Artazostra at his side with a bitter smile. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lady, your people have their will. But do not think Athena Nikephorus, the Lady of
              Triumphs, will forget this day when we stand against you in battle.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She did not answer him. He knew that many noblemen had advised Xerxes against driving
            the Greeks to desperation by this sacrilege, but this fact hardly made him the happier. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At dusk the next evening Mardonius suffered him to go with two faithful eunuchs and
            rove through the deserted city. The Persians were mostly encamped without the walls, and
            plundering was forbidden. Only Hydarnes with the Immortals pitched on Areopagus, and the
            king had taken his abode by the Agora. It was like walking through the country of the
            dead. Everything familiar, everything changed. The eunuchs carried torches. They
            wandered down one street after another, where the house doors stood open, where the
            aulas were strewn with the débris of household stuff which the fleeing citizens had
            abandoned. A deserter had already told Glaucon of his father’s death; he was not amazed
            therefore to find the house of his birth empty and desolate. But everywhere else, also,
            it was to call back memories of glad days never to return. Here was the school where
            crusty Pollicharmes had driven the <span class="tei tei-q">“reading, writing, and music”</span> into Democrates
            and himself between the blows. Here was the corner Hermes, before which he had
            sacrificed the day <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he won his first wreath in the
            public games. Here was the house of Cimon, in whose dining room he had enjoyed many a
            bright symposium. He trod the Agora and walked under the porticos where he had lounged
            in the golden evenings after the brisk stroll from the wrestling ground at Cynosarges,
            and had chatted and chaffered with light-hearted friends about <span class="tei tei-q">“the war”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the
              king,”</span> in the days when the Persian seemed very far away. Last of all an
            instinct—he could not call it desire—drove him to seek the house of Hermippus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They had to force the door open with a stone. The first red torch-light that glimmered
            around the aula told that the Eumolpid had awaited the enemy in Athens, not in Eleusis.
            The court was littered with all manner of stuff,—crockery, blankets, tables,
            stools,—which the late inhabitants had been forced to forsake. A tame quail hopped from
            the tripod by the now cold hearth. Glaucon held out his hand, the bird came quickly,
            expecting the bit of grain. Had not Hermione possessed such a quail? The outlaw’s blood
            ran quicker. He felt the heat glowing in his forehead. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A chest of clothes stood open by the entrance. He dragged forth the contents—women’s
            dresses and uppermost a white airy gauze of Amorgos that clung to his hands as if he
            were lifting clouds. Out of its folds fell a pair of white shoes with clasps of gold.
            Then he recognized this dress Hermione had worn in the Panathenæa and on the night of
            his ruin. He threw it down, next stood staring over it like a man possessed. The
            friendly eunuchs watched his strange movements. He could not endure to have them follow
            him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me a torch. I return in a moment.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He went up the stair alone to the upper story, to the chambers of the women. Confusion
            here also,—the more valuable possessions gone, but much remaining. In one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>corner stood the loom and stretched upon it the half-made web of
            a shawl. He could trace the pattern clearly wrought in bright wools,—Ariadne sitting
            desolate awaiting the returning of Theseus. Would the wife or the betrothed of
            Democrates busy herself with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>, whatever the griefs in her
            heart? Glaucon’s temples now were throbbing as if to burst. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A second room, and more littered confusion, but in one corner stood a bronze
            statue,—Apollo bending his bow against the Achæans,—which Glaucon had given to
            Hermione. At the foot of the statue hung a wreath of purple asters, dead and dry, but he
            plucked it asunder and set many blossoms in his breast. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A third room, and almost empty. He was moving back in disappointment, when the
            torch-light shook over something that swung betwixt two beams,—a wicker cradle. The
            woollen swaddling bands were still in it. One could see the spot on the little pillow
            with the impress of the tiny head. Glaucon almost dropped the torch. He pressed his hand
            to his brow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus pity me!”</span> he groaned, <span class="tei tei-q">“preserve my reason. How can I serve Hellas and those
              I love if thou strikest me mad?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With feverish anxiety he sent his eyes around that chamber. His search was not in
            vain. He almost trampled upon the thing that lay at his feet,—a wooden rattle, the toy
            older than the Egyptian pyramids. He seized it, shook it as a warrior his sword. He
            scanned it eagerly. Upon the handle were letters carved, but there was a mist before his
            eyes which took long to pass away. Then he read the rude inscription: <span class="tei tei-q">“ΦΟΙΝΙΞ : ΥΙΟΣ : ΓΛΑΥΚΟΝΤΟΣ.”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Phœnix the son of Glaucon.”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">His</span></span> child. He was the father of a fair son. His wife, he was sure
            thereof, had not yet been given to Democrates. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span>
          <a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Overcome by a thousand emotions, he flung himself upon a chest and pressed the homely
            toy many times to his lips. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a long interval he recovered himself enough to go down to the eunuchs, who were
            misdoubting his long absence. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Persian,”</span> he said to Mardonius, when he was again at the bow-bearer’s tents, <span class="tei tei-q">“either suffer me to go back to my people right soon or put me to death. My wife has
              borne me a son. My place is where I can defend him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius frowned, but nodded his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You know I desire it otherwise. But my word is given. And the word of a prince of the
              Aryans is not to be recalled. You know what to expect among your people—perhaps a
              foul death for a deed of another.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I know it. I also know that Hellas needs me.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To fight against us?”</span> asked the bow-bearer, with a sigh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet you shall go. Eran
              is not so weak that adding one more to her enemies will halt her triumph. To-morrow
              night a boat shall be ready on the strand. Take it. And after that may your gods guard
              you, for I can do no more.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All the next day Glaucon sat in the tents and watched the smoke cloud above the
            Acropolis and the soldiers in the plain hewing down the sacred olives, Athena’s trees,
            which no Athenian might injure and thereafter live. But Glaucon was past cursing
            now,—endure a little longer and after that, what vengeance! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The gossiping eunuchs told readily what the king had determined. Xerxes was at
            Phaleron reviewing his fleet. The Hellenes’ ships confronted him at Salamis. The
            Persians had met in council, deliberating one night over their wine, reconsidering the
            next morning when sober. Their wisdom each time had been to force a battle. Let the king
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>destroy the enemy at Salamis, and he could land
            troops at ease at the very doors of Sparta, defying the vain wall across the Isthmus.
            Was not victory certain? Had he not two ships to the Hellenes’ one? So the Phœnician
            vassal kings and all his admirals assured him. Only Artemisia, the martial queen of
            Halicarnassus, spoke otherwise, but none would hear her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow the war is ended,”</span> a cup-bearer had told a butler in Glaucon’s hearing,
            and never noticed how the Athenian took a horseshoe in his slim fingers and straightened
            it, whilst looking on the scorched columns of the Acropolis. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At length the sun spread his last gold of the evening. The eunuchs called Glaucon to
            the pavilion of Artazostra, who came forth with Roxana for their farewell. They were in
            royal purple. The amethysts in their hair were worth a month’s revenues of Corinth.
            Roxana had never been lovelier. Glaucon was again in the simple Greek dress, but he
            knelt and kissed the robes of both the women. Then rising he spoke to them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To you, O princess, my benefactress, I wish all manner of blessing. May you be
              crowned with happy age, may your fame surpass Semiramis, the conqueror queen of the
              fables, let the gods refuse only one prayer—the conquest of Hellas. The rest of the
              world is yours, leave then to us our own.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And you, sister of Mardonius,”</span> he turned to Roxana now, <span class="tei tei-q">“do not think I despise
              your love or your beauty. That I have given you pain, is double pain to me. But I
              loved you only in a dream. My life is not for the rose valleys of Bactria, but for the
              stony hills by Athens. May Aphrodite give you another love, a brighter fortune than
              might ever come by linking your fate to mine.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They held out their hands. He kissed them. He saw tears on the long lashes of Roxana. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell,”</span> spoke the women, simply. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell,”</span> he answered. He turned from them. He knew they were re-entering the
            tent. He never saw the women again. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius accompanied him all the long way from the fount of Callirhoë to the
            sea-shore. Glaucon protested, but the bow-bearer would not hearken. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You have saved my life, Athenian,”</span> was his answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“when you leave me now, it is
              forever.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The moon was lifting above the gloomy mass of Hymettus and scattering all the Attic
            plain with her pale gold. The Acropolis Rock loomed high above them. Glaucon, looking
            upward, saw the moonlight flash on the spear point and shield of a soldier,—a Barbarian
            standing sentry on the ruined shrine of the Virgin Goddess. Once more the Alcmæonid was
            leaving Athens, but with very different thoughts than on that other night when he had
            fled at Phormio’s side. They quitted the desolate city and the sleeping camp. The last
            bars of day had long since dimmed in the west when before them loomed the hill of
            Munychia clustered also with tents, and beyond it the violet-black vista of the sea. A
            forest of masts crowded the havens, the fleet of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the World”</span> that was
            to complete his mastery with the returning sun. Mardonius did not lead Glaucon to the
            ports, but southward, where beyond the little point of Colias spread an open sandy
            beach. The night waves lapped softly. The wind had sunk to warm puffs from the
            southward. They heard the rattle of anchor-chains and tackle-blocks, but from far away.
            Beyond the vague promontory of Peiræus rose dark mountains and headlands, at their foot
            lay a sprinkling of lights. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Salamis!”</span> cried Glaucon, pointing. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yonder are the ships of Hellas.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius walked with him upon the shelving shore. A skiff, small but stanch, was
            ready with oars. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What else will you?”</span> asked the bow-bearer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Gold?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing. Yet take this.”</span> Glaucon unclasped from his waist the golden belt Xerxes
            had bestowed at Sardis. <span class="tei tei-q">“A Hellene I went forth, a Hellene I return.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He made to kiss the Persian’s dress, but Mardonius would not suffer it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Did I not desire you for my brother?”</span> he said, and they embraced. As their arms
            parted, the bow-bearer spoke three words in earnest whisper:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of Democrates.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I can say no more. Yet be wise. Beware of Democrates.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The attendants, faithful body-servants of Mardonius, and mute witnesses of all that
            passed, were thrusting the skiff into the water. There were no long farewells. Both knew
            that the parting was absolute, that Glaucon might be dead on the morrow. A last clasping
            of the hands and quickly the boat was drifting out upon the heaving waters. Glaucon
            stood one moment watching the figures on the beach and pondering on Mardonius’s strange
            warning. Then he set himself to the oars, rowing westward, skirting the Barbarian fleet
            as it rode at anchor, observing its numbers and array and how it was aligned for battle.
            After that, with more rapid stroke, he sent the skiff across the dark ribbon toward
            Salamis. </p>

          <h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%"> THEMISTOCLES IS THINKING </span></h2>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Leonidas was taken. Themistocles was left,—left to bear as crushing a load as ever
            weighed on man,—to fight two battles, one with the Persian, one with his own unheroic
            allies, and the last was the harder. Three hundred and seventy Greek triremes rode off
            Salamis, half from Athens, but the commander-in-chief was Eurybiades of Sparta, the
            sluggard state that sent only sixteen ships, yet the only state the bickering
            Peloponnesians would obey. Hence Themistocles’s sore problems. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Different from the man of unruffled brow who ruled from the bema was he who paced the
            state cabin of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> a few nights after the evacuation.
            For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></span> at least knew the morn would bring Hellas her doom. There
            had been a gloomy council that afternoon. They had seen the Acropolis flame two days
            before. The great fleet of Xerxes rode off the Attic havens. At the gathering of the
            Greek chiefs in Eurybiades’s cabin Themistocles had spoken one word many times,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Fight!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To which Adeimantus, the craven admiral of Corinth, and many another had answered:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Delay! Back to the Isthmus! Risk nothing!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then at last the son of Neocles silenced them, not with arguments but threats. <span class="tei tei-q">“Either here in the narrow straits we can fight the king or not at all. In the open
              seas his numbers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>can crush us. Either vote to fight
              here or we Athenians sail for Italy and leave you to stem Xerxes as you can.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There had been sullen silence after that, the admirals misliking the furrow drawn
            above Themistocles’s eyes. Then Eurybiades had haltingly given orders for battle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That had been the command, but as the Athenian left the Spartan flag-ship in his
              pinnace he heard Globryas, the admiral of Sicyon, muttering, <span class="tei tei-q">“Headstrong fool—he
              shall not destroy us!”</span> and saw Adeimantus turn back for a word in Eurybiades’s ear.
            The Spartan had shaken his head, but Themistocles did not deceive himself. In the battle
            at morn half of the Hellenes would go to battle asking more <span class="tei tei-q">“how escape?”</span> than <span class="tei tei-q">“how conquer?”</span> and that was no question to ask before a victory. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The cabin was empty now save for the admiral. On the deck above the hearty shouts of
            <a name="corr280" id="corr280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Ameinias</span> the trierarch, and chanting of the seamen told that on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> at least there would be no slackness in the fight. The ship was being
            stripped for action, needless spars and sails sent ashore, extra oars made ready, and
            grappling-irons placed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Battle”</span> was what every Athenian prayed for, but amongst
            the allies Themistocles knew it was otherwise. The crucial hour of his life found him
            nervous, moody, silent. He repelled the zealous subalterns who came for orders. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My directions have been given. Execute them. Has Aristeides come yet?”</span> The last
            question was to Simonides, who had been half-companion, half-counsellor, in all these
            days of storm. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He is not yet come from Ægina.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Leave me, then.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles’s frown deepened. The others went out. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The state cabin was elegant, considering its place. Themistocles had furnished it
            according to his luxurious taste,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>—stanchions cased in
            bronze hammered work, heavy rugs from Carthage, lamps swinging from chains of precious
            Corinthian brass. Behind a tripod stood an image of Aphrodite of Fair Counsel, the
            admiral’s favourite deity. By force of habit now he crossed the cabin, took the golden
            box, and shook a few grains of frankincense upon the tripod. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Attend, O queen,”</span> he said mechanically, <span class="tei tei-q">“and be thou propitious to all my
              prayers.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He knew the words meant nothing. The puff of night air from the port-hole carried the
            fragrance from the room. The image wore its unchanging, meaningless smile, and
            Themistocles smiled too, albeit bitterly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“So this is the end. A losing fight, cowardice, slavery—no, I shall not live to see
              that last.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He looked from the port-hole. He could see the lights of the Barbarian fleet clearly.
            He took long breaths of the clear brine. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“So the tragedy ends—worse than Phrynicus’s poorest, when they pelted his chorus from
              the orchestra with date-stones. And yet—and yet—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He never formulated what came next even in his own mind. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eu!</span></span>”</span> he cried, springing back with part of his old
            lightness, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have borne a brave front before it all. I have looked the Cyclops in the
              face, even when he glowered the fiercest. But it all will pass. I presume Thersytes
              the caitiff and Agamemnon the king have the same sleep and the same dreams in Orchus.
              And a few years more or a few less in a man’s life make little matter. But it would be
              sweeter to go out thinking <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have triumphed’</span> than <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have failed, and all the
                things I loved fail with me.’</span> And Athens—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again he stopped. When he resumed his monologue, it was in a different key. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There are many things I cannot understand. They can<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not unlock the riddles at Delphi, no seer can read them in the omens of birds. Why
              was Glaucon blasted? Was he a traitor? What was the truth concerning his treason?
              Since his going I have lost half my faith in mortal men.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Once more his thoughts wandered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“How they trust me, my followers of Athens! Is it not better to be a leader of one
              city of freemen than a Xerxes, master of a hundred million slaves? How they greeted
              me, as if I were Apollo the Saviour, when I returned to Peiræus! And must it be
              written by the chroniclers thereafter, <span class="tei tei-q">‘About this time Themistocles, son of
                Neocles, aroused the Athenians to hopeless resistance and drew on them utter
                destruction’</span>? O Father Zeus, must men say <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>? Am I a
              fool or crazed for wishing to save my land from the fate of Media, Lydia, Babylonia,
              Egypt, Ionia? Has dark Atropos decreed that the Persians should conquer forever? Then,
              O Zeus, or whatever be thy name, O Power of Powers, look to thine empire! Xerxes is
              not a king, but a god; he will besiege Olympus, even thy throne.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He crossed the cabin with hard strides. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“How can I?”</span> he cried half-aloud, beating his forehead. <span class="tei tei-q">“How can I make these
              Hellenes fight?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His hand tightened over his sword-hilt. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the only place where we can fight to advantage. Here in the strait betwixt
              Salamis and Attica we have space to deploy all our ships, while the Barbarians will be

                about—<span class="tei tei-q">‘The wall, the wall across the Isthmus! The king can never storm it.’</span>
              Nor will he try to, unless his councillors are turned stark mad. Will he not have

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Leave me!”</span> ordered Themistocles, with a sweep of the hand, and Simonides was wise

            in part concealed by a thick beard and a peaked cap drawn low upon his forehead. The

            sturdy boatmen sent the pinnace dancing. All through the brief voyage the admiral was at
            whispers with Sicinnus. As they reached the Spartan flag-ship, half a score of pinnaces
            trailing behind told how the Peloponnesian admirals were already aboard clamouring at
            Eurybiades for orders to fly. From the ports of the stern-cabin the glare of many lamps
            spread wavering bars of light across the water. Voices came, upraised in jarring debate.
            The marine guard saluted with his spear as Themistocles went up the ladder. Leaving his
            companions on deck, the admiral hastened below. An instant later he was back and
            beckoned the Asiatic and the outlaw to the ship’s rail. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Take Sicinnus to the Persian high admiral,”</span> was his ominous whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“and fail
              not,—fail not, for I say to you except the god prosper you now, not all Olympus can
              save our Hellas to-morrow.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Not another word as he turned again to the cabin. The pinnace crew had brought the
            skiff alongside, Sicinnus entered it, Glaucon took the oars, pulled out a little, as if
            back to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>, then sent the head of the skiff around,
            pointing across the strait, toward the havens of Athens. Sicinnus sat in silence, but
            Glaucon guessed the errand. The wind was rising and bringing clouds. This would hide the
            moon and lessen the danger. But above all things speed was needful. The athlete put his
            strength upon the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>oars till the heavy skiff shot across
            the black void of the water. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was little short of midnight when Glaucon swung the skiff away from the tall
            trireme of Ariabignes, the Barbarian’s admiral. The deed was done. He had sat in the
            bobbing boat while Sicinnus had been above with the Persian chiefs. Officers who had
            exchanged the wine-cup with Glaucon in the days when he stood at Xerxes’s side passed
            through the glare of the battle lanterns swaying above the rail. The Athenian had
            gripped at the dagger in his belt as he watched them. Better in the instant of discovery
            to slay one’s self than die a few hours afterward by slow tortures! But discovery had
            not come. Sicinnus had come down the ladder, smiling, jesting, a dozen subalterns
            salaaming as he went, and offering all manner of service, for had he not been a bearer
            of great good tidings to the king? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Till to-morrow,”</span> an olive-skinned Cilician navarch had spoken. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Till to-morrow,”</span> waved the messenger, lightly. He did all things coolly, as if he
            had been bearing an invitation to a feast, took his post in the stern of the skiff
            deliberately, then turned to the silent man with him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Pull.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Whither?”</span> Glaucon was already tugging the oars. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To Eurybiades’s ship. Themistocles is waiting. And again all speed.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The line of twinkling water betwixt the skiff and the Persian widened. For a few
            moments Glaucon bent himself silently to his task, then for the first time questioned. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What have you done?”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Even in the darkness he knew Sicinnus grinned and showed his teeth. </p>

              no battle in the morning, but the Hellenes will fall into the hands of Xerxes
              unresisting.”</span>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The outlaw made no answer, but pulled at the oars. The reaction from the day and
            evening of strain and peril was upon him. He was unutterably weary, though more in mind
            than in body. The clumsy skiff seemed only to crawl. Trusting the orders of Sicinnus to
            steer him aright, he closed his eyes. One picture after another of his old life came up
            before him now he was in the stadium at Corinth and facing the giant Spartan, now he
            stood by Hermione on the sacred Rock at Athens, now he was at Xerxes’s side with the
            fleets and the myriads passing before them at the Hellespont, he saw his wife, he saw
            Roxana, and all other things fair and lovely that had crossed his life. Had he made the
            best choice? Were the desperate fates of Hellas better than the flower-banked streams of
            Bactria, whose delights he had forever thrust by? Would his Fortune, guider of every
            human destiny, bring him at last to a calm haven, or would his life go out amid the
            crashing ships to-morrow? The oars bumped on the thole-pins. He pulled mechanically, the
            revery ever deepening, then a sharp hail awoke him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O-op! What do you here?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The call was in Phœnician. Glaucon scarce knew the harsh Semitic speech, but the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lembos</span></span>, a many-oared patrol cutter, was nearly on them. A moment
            more, and seizure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would be followed by identification.
            Life, death, Hellas, Hermione, all flashed before his eyes as he sat numbed, but
            Sicinnus saved them both. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The password to-night? You know it,”</span> he demanded in quick whisper. </p>

            Not till there was a safe stretch betwixt them did Glaucon begin to grow hot, then cold,
            then hot again. Chill Thanatos had passed and missed by a hair’s breadth. Again the
            bumping of the oars and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the slow, slow creeping over
            the water. The night was darkening. The clouds had hid the moon and all her stars.
            Sicinnus, shrewd and weatherwise, remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“There will be a stiff wind in the
              morning,”</span> and lapsed into silence. Glaucon toiled on resolutely. A fixed conviction
            was taking possession of his mind,—one that had come on the day he had been preserved
            at Thermopylæ, now deepened by the event just passed,—that he was being reserved by the
            god for some crowning service to Hellas, after which should come peace, whether the
            peace of a warrior who dies in the arms of victory, whether the peace of a life spent
            after a deed well done, he scarcely knew, and in the meantime, if the storms must beat
            and the waves rise up against him, he would bear them still. Like the hero of his race,
            he could say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Already have I suffered much and much have I toiled in perils of waves
              and war, let this be added to the tale of those.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Bump—bump, the oars played their monotonous music on the thole-pins. Sicinnus stirred
            on his seat. He was peering northward anxiously, and Glaucon knew what he was seeking.
            Through the void of the night their straining eyes saw masses gliding across the face of
            the water. Ariabignes was making his promise good. Yonder the Egyptian fleet were
            swinging forth to close the last retreat of the Hellenes. Thus on the north, and
            southward, too, other triremes were thrusting out, bearing—both watchers wisely
            guessed—a force to disembark on Psyttaleia, the islet betwixt Salamis and the main, a
            vantage-point in the coming battle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The coming battle? It was so silent, ghostlike, far away, imagination scarce could
            picture it. Was this black slumberous water to be the scene at dawn of a combat beside
            which that of Hector and Achilles under Troy would be only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as a tale that is told? And was he, Glaucon, son of Conon the Alcmæonid,
            sitting there in the skiff alone with Sicinnus, to have a part therein, in a battle the
            fame whereof should ring through the ages? Bump, bump—still the monologue of the oars.
            A fish near by leaped from the water, splashing loudly. Then for an instant the clouds
            broke. Selene uncovered her face. The silvery flash quickly come, more quickly flying,
            showed him the headlands of that Attica now in Xerxes’s hands. He saw Pentelicus and
            Hymettus, Parnes and Cithæron, the hills he had wandered over in glad boyhood, the hills
            where rested his ancestors’ dust. It was no dream. He felt his warm blood quicken. He
            felt the round-bowed skiff spring over the waves, as with unwearied hands he tugged at
            the oar. There are moments when the dullest mind grows prophetic, and the mind of the
            Athenian was not dull. The moonlight had vanished. In its place through the magic
            darkness seemed gathering all the heroes of his people beckoning him and his compeers
            onward. Perseus was there, and Theseus and Erechtheus, Heracles the Mighty, and Odysseus
            the Patient, whose intellect Themistocles possessed, Solon the Wise, Periander the
            Crafty, Diomedes the Undaunted, men of reality, men of fable, sages, warriors, demigods,
            crowding together, speaking one message: <span class="tei tei-q">“Be strong, for the heritage of what you do
              this coming day shall be passed beyond children’s children, shall be passed down to
              peoples to whom the tongue, the gods, yea, the name of Hellas, are but as a dream.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon felt the weariness fly from him. He was refreshed as never by wine. Then
            through the void in place of the band of heroes slowly outspread the tracery of a vessel
            at anchor,—the outermost guardship of the fleet of the Hellenes. They were again
            amongst friends. The watcher on the trireme was keeping himself awake after the manner
            of sentries by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>singing. In the night-stillness the

            of the Greek fleet better than he, a second time they came beside the Spartan admiral.
            The lamps were still burning in the stern-cabin. Even before they were alongside, they
            caught the clamours of fierce debate. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Still arguing?”</span> quoth Sicinnus to the yawning marine officer who advanced to greet

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Still arguing,”</span> grunted the Spartan. <span class="tei tei-q">“I think your master has dragged forth all

            water-glass that marked the passing of the hours. The lamps in the low-ceiled cabin were
            flickering dimly. Men glared on one another across the narrow table with drawn and
            heated faces. Adeimantus of Corinth was rising to reply to the last appeal of the
            Athenian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We have had enough, Eurybiades, of Themistocles’s wordy folly. Because the Athenian
              admiral is resolved to lead all Hellas to destruction, is no reason that we should
              follow. As for his threat that he will desert us with his ships if we refuse to fight,
              I fling it in his face that he dare not make it good. Why go all over the
              well-threshed straw again? Is not the fleet of the king overwhelming? Were we not
              saved by a miracle from overthrow at Artemisium? Do not the scouts tell us the
              Persians are advancing beyond Eleusis toward Megara and the Isthmus? Is not our best
              fighting blood here in the fleet? Then if the Isthmus is threatened, our business is
              to defend it and save the Peloponnesus, the last remnant of Hellas unconquered. Now
              then, headstrong son of Neocles, answer that!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Corinthian, a tall domineering man, threw back his shoulders like a boxer awaiting
            battle. Themistocles did not answer, but only smiled up at him from his seat opposite. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Eurybiades rose at the head of the table. He was a heavy, florid individual with more
            than the average Spartan’s slowness of tongue and intellect. Physically he was no
            coward, but he dreaded responsibility. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Much has been said,”</span> he announced ponderously, <span class="tei tei-q">“many opinions offered. It would

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Athenian sprang from his seat, his aspect as threatening as Apollo descending

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is my country, Adeimantus? Yonder!”</span> he pointed out the open port-hole, <span class="tei tei-q">“there rides the array of our Athenian ships. What other state in Hellas sends so many

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles’s voice rang like a trumpet. Adeimantus winced. Eurybiades broke in with
            soothing tones. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No one intends to deny your right to vote, Themistocles. The excellent Corinthian did

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The vote, the vote!”</span> urged the Sicyonian chief, from Adeimantus’s elbow, and the
            voting went on. Of more than twenty voices only three—Themistocles’s and those of the
            Æginetan and Megarian admirals—were in favour of abiding the onset. Yet even when
            Eurybiades arose to announce the decision, the son of Neocles sat with his hands
            sprawling on the table, his face set in an inscrutable smile as he looked on Adeimantus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is the plain opinion,”</span>—Eurybiades hemmed and hawed with his words,—<span class="tei tei-q">“the

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But with him rose Themistocles. He stood tall and calm, his thumbs thrust in his
            girdle. His smile was a little broader, his head held a little higher, than of wont. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Good Eurybiades, I grieve to blast the wisdom of all these valiant gentlemen, but

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Explain!”</span> a dozen shouted. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Very simply. I have had good reason to know that the king has moved forward the

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Perseus upholding the Gorgon’s head before Polydectes’s guests and turning them to
            stone wrought hardly more of a miracle than this calm announcement of Themistocles. Men
            stared at him vacantly, stunned by the tidings, then Adeimantus’s frightened wrath broke
            loose. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not ask you to thank me, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philotate</span></span>,”</span> was the easy
            answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is, however, urgent to consider whether you wish to be taken unresisting
              in the morning.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Corinthian shook his fist across the table. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is easy to see if I lie,”</span> rejoined Themistocles; <span class="tei tei-q">“send out a pinnace and note

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For an instant swords seemed about to leap from their scabbards, and the enraged
            Peloponnesians to sheathe them in the Athenian’s breast. He stood unflinching, smiling,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>while a volley of curses flew over him. Then an
            orderly summoned him on deck, while Adeimantus and his fellows foamed and contended
            below. Under the battle lantern Themistocles saw a man who was his elder in years,
            rugged in feature, with massive forehead and wise gray eyes. This was Aristeides the
            Just, the admiral’s enemy, but their feud had died when Xerxes drew near to Athens. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hands clasped heartily as the twain stood face to face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Our rivalry forever more shall be a rivalry which of us can do most to profit
            Athens,”</span> spoke the returning exile; then Aristeides told how he had even now come
            from Ægina, how he had heard of the clamours to retreat, how retreat was impossible, for
            the Persians were pressing in. A laugh from Themistocles interrupted. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My handiwork! Come to the council. They will not believe me, no, not my oath.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Aristeides told his story, and how his vessel to Salamis had scarce escaped the
            Egyptian triremes, and how by this time all entrance and exit was surely closed. But
            even now many an angry captain called him <span class="tei tei-q">“liar.”</span> The strife of words was at white
            heat when Eurybiades himself silenced the fiercest doubter. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Captains of Hellas, a trireme of Teos has deserted from the Barbarian to us. Her

            blown apart before the rising wind. The debate must end. Eurybiades stood again to take

            genius had possessed him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You have your will, Themistocles,”</span> he made the concession sullenly yet firmly, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have your will. May Poseidon prove you in the right. If it is battle or slavery
              at dawn, the choice is quick. Battle!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Battle!”</span> shouted the twenty, arising together, and Eurybiades had no need to
            declare the vote. The commanders scattered to their flag-ships, to give orders to be
            ready to fight at dawn. Themistocles went to his pinnace last. He walked proudly. He
            knew that whatever glory he might gain on the morrow, he could never win a fairer
            victory than he had won that night. When his barge came alongside, his boat crew knew
            that his eyes were dancing, that his whole mien was of a man in love with his fortune.
            Many times, as Glaucon sat beside him, he heard the son of Neocles repeating as in
            ecstasy:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They must fight. They must fight.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon sat mutely in the pinnace which had headed not for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>, but toward the shore, where a few faint beacons were burning. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I must confer with the strategi as to the morning,”</span> Themistocles declared after a
            long interval, at which Sicinnus broke in anxiously:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You will not sleep, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>?”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sleep?”</span> laughed the admiral, as at an excellent jest, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have forgotten there
              was such a god as Hypnos.”</span> Then, ignoring Sicinnus, he addressed the outlaw. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am grateful to you, my friend,”</span> he did not call Glaucon by name before the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me a part to play to-morrow.”</span>
          </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thermopylæ was not brisk enough fighting, ha? Can you still fling a javelin?”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I can try.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euge!</span></span> Try you shall.”</span> He let his voice drop. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Command me, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>,”</span> said the Asiatic. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“A strange time and place, but you must do it. Find some dark dye for this man’s hair

              others’ star-gazing. Sleep sound. Pray Apollo and Hephæstus to make your eye sure,
              your hand strong. Then awake to see the glory of Hellas.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Confidence, yes, power came through the tones of the admiral’s voice. Themistocles
            went away to the belated council. Sicinnus led his charge through the crooked streets of
            the town of Salamis. Sailors were sleeping in the open night, and they stumbled over
            them. At last they found a small tavern where a dozen shipmen sprawled on the earthen
            floor, and a gaping host was just quenching his last lamp. Sicinnus, however, seemed to
            know him. There was much protesting and headshaking, at last ended by the glint of a
            daric. The man grumbled, departed, returned after a tedious interval with a pot of
            ointment, found Hermes knew <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>where. By a rush-candle’s
            flicker Sicinnus applied the dark dye with a practised hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You know the art well,”</span> observed the outlaw. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Assuredly; the agent of Themistocles must be a Proteus with his disguises.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sicinnus laid down his pot and brushes. They had no mirror, but Glaucon knew that he
            was transformed. The host got his daric. Again they went out into the night and
            forsaking the crowded town sought the seaside. The strand was broad, the sand soft and
            cool, the circling stars gave three hours yet of night, and they lay down to rest. The
            sea and the shore stretched away, a magic vista with a thousand mystic shapes springing
            out of the charmed darkness, made and unmade as overwrought fancy summoned them. As from
            an unreal world Glaucon—whilst he lay—saw the lights of the scattered ships, heard the
            clank of chains, the rattling of tacklings. Nature slept. Only man was waking. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The school-learned lines of Alcman, with a thousand other trivial things, swarmed back
            through the head of Glaucon the Alcmæonid. How much he had lived through that night, how
            much he would live through,—if indeed he was to live,—upon the morrow! The thought was
            benumbing in its greatness. His head swam with confused memories. Then at last all
            things dimmed. Once more he dreamed. He was with Hermione gathering red poppies on the
            hill above <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Eleusis. She had filled her basket full. He
            called to her to wait for him. She ran away. He chased, she fled with laughter and
            sparkling eyes. He could hear the wavings of her dress, the little cries she flung back
            over her shoulder. Then by the sacred well near the temple he caught her. He felt her
            struggling gayly. He felt her warm breath upon his face, her hair was touching his
            forehead. Rejoicing in his strength, he was bending her head toward his—but here he
            wakened. Sicinnus had disappeared. A bar of gray gold hung over the water in the east. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This was the day. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This was the day!</span></span>”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Some moments he lay trying to realize the fact in its full moment. A thin mist rested
            on the black water waiting to be dispelled by the sun. From afar came sounds not of
            seamen’s trumpets, but horns, harps, kettledrums, from the hidden mainland across the
            strait, as of a host advancing along the shore. <span class="tei tei-q">“Xerxes goes down to the marge with
              his myriads,”</span> Glaucon told himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Have not all his captains bowed and smiled,
                <span class="tei tei-q">‘Your Eternity’s victory is certain. Come and behold.’</span> ”</span> But here the
            Athenian shut his teeth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> People at length were passing up and down the strand. The coast was waking. The gray
            bar was becoming silver. Friends passed, deep in talk,—perchance for the last time.
            Glaucon lay still a moment longer, and as he rested caught a voice so familiar he felt
            all the blood surge to his forehead,—Democrates’s voice. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I tell you, Hiram,—I told you before,—I have no part in the ordering of the fleet.

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So close were the twain, the orator’s trailing chiton almost fell on Glaucon’s face.
            The latter marvelled that his own heart did not spring from its prison in his breast, so
            fierce were its beatings. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The hint sent Democrates from the spot almost on a run. Hiram disappeared in the
            opposite direction. Glaucon rose, shook the sand from his cloak, and stood an instant
            with his head whirling. The voice of his boyhood friend, of the man who had ruined him
            because of a suspicion of treason—and now deep in compromising talk with the agent of
            the chief of the peace party at Sparta! And wherefore had Mardonius spoken those
            mysterious words at their parting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of Democrates”</span>? For an instant the
            problems evoked made him forget even the coming battle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A clear trumpet-blast down the strand gave a truce to questioning. Sicinnus
            reappeared, and led Glaucon to one of the great fires roaring on the beach, where the
            provident Greek sailors were breakfasting on barley porridge and meat broth before
            dining on spears and arrow-heads. A silent company, no laughter, no jesting. All knew
            another sun for them might never rise. Glaucon ate not because he hungered, but because
            duty ordered it. As the light strengthened, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strand
            grew alive with thousands of men at toil. The triremes drawn on shore went down into the
            sea on their rollers. More trumpet-blasts sent the rowers aboard their ships. But last
            of all, before thrusting out to do or die, the Greeks must feast their ears as well as
            their stomachs. On the sloping beach gathered the officers and the armoured
            marines,—eighteen from each trireme,—and heard one stirring harangue after another.
            The old feuds were forgotten. Adeimantus and Eurybiades both spoke bravely. The seers
            announced that every bird and cloud gave good omen. Prayer was offered to Ajax of
            Salamis that the hero should fight for his people. Last of all Themistocles spoke, and
            never to fairer purpose. No boasts, no lip courage, a painting of the noble and the
            base, the glory of dying as freemen, the infamy of existing as slaves. He told of
            Marathon, of Thermopylæ, and asked if Leonidas had died as died a fool. He drew tears.
            He drew vows of vengeance. He never drew applause. Men were too strained for that. At
            last he sent the thousands forth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Go, then. Quit yourselves as Hellenes. That is all the task. And I say to you, in the

                this man, for he saved us all at Salamis.’</span> ”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The company dispersed, each man to his ship. Themistocles went to his pinnace, and a
            cheer uprose from sea and land as the boat shot out to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>. Eurybiades might be chief in name; who did not know that Themistocles
            was the surest bulwark of Hellas? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The son of Neocles, standing in the boat, uplifted his face to the now golden east. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sunrise. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> was ready. Ameinias the navarch walked
            the deck above the stern-cabin with nervous strides. All that human forethought could do
            to prepare the ship had long been done. The slim hull one hundred and fifty feet long
            had been stripped of every superfluous rope and spar. The masts had been lowered. On the
            cat-heads hung the anchors weighted with stone to fend off an enemy, astern towed the
            pinnace ready to drag alongside and break the force of the hostile ram. The heavy-armed
            marines stood with their long boarding spears, to lead an attack or cast off
            grappling-irons. But the true weapon of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> was herself.
            To send the three-toothed beak through a foeman’s side was the end of her being. To meet
            the shock of collision two heavy cables had been bound horizontally around the hull from
            stem to stern. The oarsmen,—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thranites</span></span> of the upper tier, the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zygites</span></span> of the middle, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thalamites</span></span> of
            the lower,—one hundred and seventy swart, nervous-eyed men, sat on their benches, and
            let their hands close tight upon those oars which trailed now in the drifting water, but
            which soon and eagerly should spring to life. At the belt of every oarsman dangled a
            sword, for boarders’ work was more than likely. Thirty spare rowers rested impatiently
            on the centre deck, ready to leap wherever needed. On the forecastle commanded the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prōreus</span></span>, Ameinias’s lieutenant, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and with him the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes</span></span>, the oar master who must give time
            on his sounding-board for the rowing, and never fail,—not though the ships around
            reeled down to watery grave. And finally on the poop by the captain stood the <span class="tei tei-q">“governor,”</span>—knotted, grizzled, and keen,—the man whose touch upon the heavy
            steering oars might give the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> life or destruction when
            the ships charged beak to beak. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The trireme is ready, admiral,”</span> reported Ameinias, as Themistocles came up
            leisurely from the stern-cabin. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The son of Neocles threw back his helmet, that all might see his calm, untroubled
            face. He wore a cuirass of silvered scale-armour over his purple chiton. At his side
            walked a young man, whom the ship’s people imagined the deserter of the preceding night,
            but he had drawn his helmet close. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This is Critias,”</span> said Themistocles, briefly, to the navarch; <span class="tei tei-q">“he is a good
              caster. See that he has plenty of darts.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“One of Themistocles’s secret agents,”</span> muttered the captain to the governor, <span class="tei tei-q">“we
              should have guessed it.”</span> And they all had other things to think of than the whence
            and wherefore of this stranger. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a weary, nervous interval. Men had said everything, done everything, hoped and
            feared everything. They were in no mood even to invoke the gods. In desperation some
            jested riotously as they gripped the oars on the benches,—demonstrations which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prōreus</span></span> quelled with a loud <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence in the ship.”</span> The
            morning mist was breaking. A brisk wind was coming with the sun. Clear and strong sang
            the Notus, the breeze of the kindly south. It covered the blue bay with crisping
            whitecaps, it sent the surf foaming up along the Attic shore across the strait.
            Themistocles watched it all with silent eyes, but eyes that spoke of gladness. He knew
            the waves would beat with full force on the Persian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prows, and make their swift movement difficult while the Greeks, taking the galloping
            surf astern, would suffer little. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Æolus fights for us. The first omen and a fair one.”</span> The word ran in whispers down
            the benches, and every soul on the trireme rejoiced. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> How long did they sit thus? An æon? Would Eurybiades never draw out his line of
            battle? Would Adeimantus prove craven at the end? Would treachery undo Hellas to-day, as
            once before at Lade when the Ionian Greeks had faced the Persian fleet in vain? Now as
            the vapour broke, men began to be able to look about them, and be delivered from their
            own thoughts. The shores of Salamis were alive,—old men, women, little children,—the
            fugitives from Attica were crowding to the marge in thousands to watch the deed that
            should decide their all. And many a bronze-cheeked oarsman arose from his bench to wave
            farewell to the wife or father or mother, and sank back again,—a clutching in his
            throat, a mist before his eyes, while his grip upon the oar grew like to steel. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> rode at her place in the long line of ships
            spread up and down the shore of Salamis, it was easy to detect forms if not faces on the
            strand. And Glaucon, peering out from his helmet bars, saw Democrates himself standing
            on the sands and beckoning to Themistocles. Then other figures became clear to him out
            of the many, this one or that whom he had loved and clasped hands with in the sunlit
            days gone by. And last of all he saw those his gaze hungered for the most, Hermippus,
            Lysistra, and another standing at their side all in white, and in her arms she bore
            something he knew must be her child,—Hermione’s son, his son, born to the lot of a free
            man of Athens or a slave of Xerxes according as his elders played their part this day.
            Only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a glimpse,—the throng of strangers opened to
            disclose them closed again; Glaucon leaned on a capstan. All the strength for the moment
            was gone out of him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You rowed and wrought too much last night, Critias,”</span> spoke Themistocles, who had
            eyes for everything. <span class="tei tei-q">“To the cabin, Sicinnus, bring a cup of Chian.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No wine, for Athena’s sake!”</span> cried the outlaw, drawing himself together, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is
              passed. I am strong again.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A great shout from the shores and the waiting fleet made him forget even the sight of
            Hermione. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They come! The Persians! The Persians!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fleet of the Barbarians was advancing from the havens of Athens. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sun rose higher. He was far above Hymettus now, and shooting his bright javelins
            over mainland, islands, and waters. With his rising the southern breeze sang ever
            clearer, making the narrow channel betwixt Salamis and Attica white, and tossing each
            trireme merrily. Not a cloud hung upon Pentelicus, Hymettus, or the purple northern
            range of Parnes. Over the desolate Acropolis hovered a thin mist,—smoke from the
            smouldering temple, the sight of which made every Attic sailor blink hard and think of
            the vengeance. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yonder on the shore of the mainland the host of the Persian was moving: horsemen in
            gilded panoply, Hydarnes’s spearmen in armour like suns. They stood by myriads in
            glittering masses about a little spur of Mt. Ægaleos, where a holy close of Heracles
            looked out upon the sea. To them were coming more horsemen, chariots, litters, and
            across the strait drifted the thunderous acclamation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Victory to the king!”</span> For
            here on the ivory throne, with his mighty men, his captains, his harem, about him, the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the World”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would look down on the battle and see how his slaves
            could fight. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Now the Barbarians began to move forth by sea. From the havens of Peiræus and their
            anchorages along the shore swept their galleys,—Phœnician, Cilician, Egyptian, and,
            sorrow of sorrows, Ionian—Greek arrayed against Greek! Six hundred triremes and more
            they were, taller in poop and prow than the Hellenes, and braver to look upon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Each vied with each in the splendour of the scarlet, purple, and gold upon stern and
            foreship. Their thousands of white oars moved like the onward march of an army as they
            trampled down the foam. From the masts of their many admirals flew innumerable gay
            signal-flags. The commands shouted through trumpets in a dozen strange tongues—the
            shrill pipings of the oar masters, the hoarse shouts of the rowers—went up to heaven in
            a clamorous babel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Swallows’ chatter,”</span> cried the deriding Hellenes, but hearts
            were beating quicker, breath was coming faster in many a breast by Salamis then,—and no
            shame. For now was the hour of trial, the wrestle of Olympian Zeus with Ahura-Mazda. Now
            would a mighty one speak from the heavens to Hellas, and say to her <span class="tei tei-q">“Die!”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Be!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Barbarians’ armadas were forming. Their black beaks, all pointing toward Salamis,
            stretched in two bristling lines from the islet of Psyttaleia—whence the shields of the
            landing force glittered—to that brighter glitter on the promontory by Ægaleos where sat
            the king. To charge their array seemed charging a moving hedge of spears, impenetrable
            in defence, invincible in attack. Slowly, rocked by the sea and rowing in steady order,
            the armament approached Salamis. And still the Greek ships lay spread out along the
            shore, each trireme swinging at the end of the cable which moored her to the land, each
            mariner listening <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the beatings of his own heart and
            straining his eyes on one ship now—Eurybiades’s—which rode at the centre of their line
            and far ahead. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All could read the order of battle at last as squadron lay against squadron. On the
            west, under Xerxes’s own eye, the Athenians must charge the serried Phœnicians, at the
            centre the Æginetans must face the Cilicians, on the east Adeimantus and his fellows
            from Peloponnese must make good against the vassal Ionians. But would the signal to row
            and strike never come? Had some god numbed Eurybiades’s will? Was treachery doing its
            darkest work? With men so highly wrought moments were precious. The bow strung too long
            will lose power. And wherefore did Eurybiades tarry? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Every soul in the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> kept his curses soft, and
            waited—waited till that trailing monster, the Persian fleet, had crept halfway from
            Psyttaleia toward them, then up the shrouds of the Spartan admiral leaped a flag. Eager
            hands drew it, yet it seemed mounting as a snail, till at the masthead the clear wind
            blew it wide,—a plain red banner, but as it spread hundreds of axes were hewing the
            cables that bound the triremes to the shore, every Greek oar was biting the sea, the
            ships were leaping away from Salamis. From the strand a shout went up, a prayer more
            than a cheer, mothers, wives, little ones, calling it together:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus prosper you!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A roar from the fleet, the tearing of countless blades on the thole-pins answered
            them. Eurybiades had spoken. There was no treason. All now was in the hand of the god. </p>
          <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Across the strait they went, and the Barbarians seemed springing to meet them. From
            the mainland a tumult of voices was rising, the myriads around Xerxes encouraging <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their comrades by sea to play the man. No indecisive,
            half-hearted battle should this be, as at Artemisium. Persian and Hellene knew that. The
            keen Phœnicians, who had chafed at being kept from action so long, sent their line of
            ships sweeping over the waves with furious strokes. The grudges, the commercial
            rivalries between Greek and Sidonian, were old. No Persian was hotter for Xerxes’s cause
            than his Phœnician vassals that day. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And as they charged, the foemen’s lines seemed so dense, their ships so tall, their
            power so vast, that involuntarily hesitancy came over the Greeks. Their strokes slowed.
            The whole line lagged. Here an Æginetan galley dropped behind, yonder a Corinthian
            navarch suffered his men to back water. Even the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes</span></span> of the
              <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> slackened his beating on the sounding-board.
            Eurybiades’s ship had drifted behind to the line of her sisters, as in defiance a
            towering Sidonian sprang ahead of the Barbarian line of battle, twenty trumpets from her
            poop and foreship asking, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dare you meet me?”</span> The Greek line became almost
            stationary. Some ships were backing water. It was a moment which, suffered to slip
            unchecked, leads to irreparable disaster. Then like a god sprang Themistocles upon the
            capstan on his poop. He had torn off his helmet. The crews of scores of triremes saw
            him. His voice was like Stentor’s, the herald whose call was strong as fifty common men. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In a lull amidst the howls of the Barbarians his call rang up and down the flagging
            ships:— </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Navarch shouted it to navarch. The
            cry went up and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>down the line of the Hellenes, <span class="tei tei-q">“loud
              as when billows lash the beetling crags.”</span> The trailing oars beat again into the
            water, and even as the ships once more gained way, Themistocles nodded to Ameinias, and
            he to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes</span></span>. The master oarsman leaped from his seat and
            crashed his gavel down upon the sounding-board. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> answered with a leap. Men wrought at the oar
            butts, tugging like mad, their backs toward the foe, conscious only that duty bade them
            send the trireme across the waves as a stone whirls from the sling. Thus the men, but
            Themistocles, on the poop, standing at the captain’s and governor’s side, never took his
            gaze from the great Barbarian that leaped defiantly to meet them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Can we risk the trick?”</span> his swift question to Ameinias. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The captain nodded. <span class="tei tei-q">“With this crew—yes.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Two stadia, one stadium, half a stadium, a ship’s length, the triremes were charging
            prow to prow, rushing on a common death, when Ameinias clapped a whistle to his lips and
            blew shrilly. As one man every rower on the port-side leaped to his feet and dragged his
            oar inward through its row-hole. The deed was barely done ere the Sidonian was on them.
            They heard the roaring water round her prow, the cracking of the whips as the petty
            officers ran up and down the gangways urging on the panting cattle at the oars. Then
            almost at the shock the governor touched his steering oar. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> swerved. The prow of the Sidonian rushed past them. A shower of darts
            pattered down on the deck of the Hellene, but a twinkling later from the Barbarians
            arose a frightful cry. Right across her triple oar bank, still in full speed, ploughed
            the Athenian. The Sidonian’s oars were snapping like faggots. The luckless rowers were
            flung from their benches in heaps. In less time than the telling every oar on the
            Barbarian’s port-side <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had been put out of play. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">diekplous</span></span>, favourite trick of the Grecian seamen, had never been
            done more fairly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Now was Themistocles’s chance. He used it. There was no need for him to give orders to
            the oar master. Automatically every rower on the port-tiers of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> had run out his blade again. The governor sent the head of the trireme
            around with a grim smile locked about his grizzled lips. It was no woman’s task which
            lay before them. Exposing her whole broadside lay the long Sidonian; she was helpless,
            striving vainly to crawl away with her remaining oar banks. Her people were running to
            and fro, howling to Baal, Astarte, Moloch, and all their other foul gods, and stretching
            their hands for help to consorts too far away. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aru! Aru! Aru!</span></span>”</span> was the shout of the oar master; again the
              <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> answered with her leap. Straight across the narrow
            water she shot, the firm hand of the governor never veering now. The stroke grew faster,
            faster. Then with one instinct men dropped the oars, to trail in the rushing water, and
            seized stanchions, beams, anything to brace themselves for the shock. The crash which
            followed was heard on the mainland and on Salamis. The side of the Phœnician was beaten
            in like an egg-shell. From the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> poop they saw her open
            hull reel over, saw the hundreds of upturned, frantic faces, heard the howls of agony,
            saw the waves leap into the gaping void.— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Back water,”</span> thundered Ameinias, <span class="tei tei-q">“clear the vortex, she is going down!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> people staggered to the oars. So busy were they
            in righting their own ship few saw the crowning horror. A moment more and a few drifting
            spars, a few bobbing heads, were all that was left of the Phœnician. The Ægean had
            swallowed her. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span>
          <a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A shout was pealing from the ships of the Hellenes. <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus is with us! Athena is with

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the outset of the battle, when advantage tells the most, advantage had been won.
            Themistocles’s deed had fused all the Greeks with hopeful courage. Eurybiades was
            charging. Adeimantus was charging. Their ships and all the rest went racing to meet the
            foe. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> had paid for her victory. In the shock of
            ramming the triple-toothed beak on her prow had been wrenched away. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mêlée</span></span> of ships which had just begun, she must play her part robbed
            of her keenest weapon. The sinking of the Barbarian had been met with cheers by the
            Hellenes, by howls of revengeful rage by the host against them. Not lightly were the
            Asiatics who fought beneath the eyes of the king to be daunted. They came crowding up
            the strait in such masses that sheer numbers hindered them, leaving no space for the
            play of the oars, much less for fine manœuvre. Yet for an instant it seemed as if mere
            weight would sweep the Hellenes back to Salamis. Then the lines of battle dissolved into
            confused fragments. Captains singled out an opponent and charged home desperately,
            unmindful how it fared elsewhere in the battle. Here an Egyptian ran down a Eubœan,
            there a Sicyonian grappled a Cilician and flung her boarders on to the foeman’s decks.
            To the onlookers the scene could have meant naught save confusion. A hundred duels, a
            hundred varying victories, but to which side the final glory would fall, who
            knew?—perchance not even Zeus. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the roaring <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mêlée</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> had
            for some moments moved almost aimlessly, her men gathering breath and letting their
            unscathed comrades pass. Then gradually the battle drifted round them also. A Cyprian,
            noting they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had lost their ram, strove to charge them
            bow to bow. The skill of the governor avoided that disaster. They ran under the stem of
            a Tyrian, and Glaucon proved he had not forgotten his skill when he sent his javelins
            among the officers upon the poop. A second Sidonian swept down on them, but grown wise
            by her consort’s destruction turned aside to lock with an Æginetan galley. How the fight
            at large was going, who was winning, who losing, Glaucon saw no more than any one else.
            An arrow grazed his arm. He first learned it when he found his armour bloody. A
            sling-stone smote the marine next to him on the forehead. The man dropped without a
            groan. Glaucon flung the body overboard, almost by instinct. Themistocles was
            everywhere, on the poop, on the foreship, among the rowers’ benches, shouting, laughing,
            cheering, ordering, standing up boldly where the arrows flew thickest, yet never hit. So
            for a while, till out of the confusion of ships and wrecks came darting a trireme,
            loftier than her peers. The railing on poop and prow was silver. The shields of the
            javelin-men that crowded her high fighting decks were gilded. Ten pennons whipped from
            her masts, and the cry of horns, tambours, and kettledrums blended with the shoutings of
            her crew. A partially disabled Hellene drifted across her path. She ran the luckless
            ship down in a twinkling. Then her bow swung. She headed toward the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you know this ship?”</span> asked Themistocles, at Glaucon’s side on the poop. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A Tyrian, the newest in their fleet, but her captain is the admiral Ariamenes,

            <span class="tei tei-q">“She is attacking us, Excellency,”</span> called Ameinias, in his chief’s ear. The din
            which covered the sea was beyond telling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles measured the water with his eye. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“She will be alongside then in a moment,”</span> was his answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the beak is
            gone?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gone, and ten of our best rowers are dead.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles drew down the helmet, covering his face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euge!</span></span> Since the choice is to grapple or fly, we had better
              grapple.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The governor shifted again the steering paddles. The head of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> fell away toward her attacker, but no signal was given to quicken the
            oars. The Barbarian, noting what her opponent did, but justly fearing the handiness of
            the Greeks, slackened also. The two ships drifted slowly together. Long before they
            closed in unfriendly contact the arrows of the Phœnician pelted over the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> like hail. Rowers fell as they sat on the upper benches;
            on the poop the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prōreus</span></span> lay with half his men. Glaucon never
            counted how many missiles dinted his helmet and buckler. The next instant the two ships
            were drifting without steerage-way. The grappling-irons dashed down upon the Athenian,
            and simultaneously the brown Phœnician boarders were scrambling like cats upon her
            decks. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Swords, men!”</span> called Themistocles, never less daunted than at the pinch, <span class="tei tei-q">“up and
              feed them with iron!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Three times the Phœnicians poured as a flood over the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>.
            Three times they were flung back with loss, but only to rage, call on their gods, and
            return with tenfold fury. Glaucon had hurled one sheaf of javelins, and tore loose
            another, eye and arm aiming, casting mechanically. In the lulls he saw how wind and sea
            were sweeping the two ships landward, until almost in arrow-shot of the rocky point
            where sat Xerxes and his lords. He saw the king upon his ivory throne and all his mighty
            men around him. He saw the scribes standing near with parchment and papyrus, inscribing
            the names of this or that ship which did well or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ill in
            behalf of the lord of the Aryans. He saw the gaudy dresses of the eunuchs, the litters,
            and from them peering forth the veiled women. Did Artazostra think <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></span> the Hellenes were mad fools to look her brother’s power in the face? From the
            shores of Attica and of Salamis, where the myriads rejoiced or wept as the scattered
            battle changed, the cries were rising, falling, like the throb of a tragic chorus,—a
            chorus of Titans, with the actors gods. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Another charge!”</span> shouted Ameinias, through the din, <span class="tei tei-q">“meet them briskly,
            lads!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Once more the hoarse Semitic war-shout, the dark-faced Asiatics dropping upon the
            decks, the whir of javelins, the scream of dying men, the clash of steel on steel. A
            frantic charge, but stoutly met. Themistocles was in the thickest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mêlée</span></span>. With his own spear he dashed two Tyrians overboard, as they sprang upon
            the poop. The band that had leaped down among the oar benches were hewn in pieces by the
            seamen. The remnant of the attackers recoiled in howls of despair. On the Phœnician’s
            decks the Greeks saw the officers laying the lash mercilessly across their men, but the
            disheartened creatures did not stir. Now could be seen Ariamenes, the high admiral
            himself, a giant warrior in his purple and gilded armour, going up and down the poop,
            cursing, praying, threatening,—all in vain. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span>
            people rose and cheered madly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Enough! They have enough! Glory to Athens!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But here Ameinias gripped Themistocles’s arm. The chief turned, and all the Hellenes
            with him. The cheer died on their lips. A tall trireme was bearing down on them in full
            charge even while the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> drifted. They were as helpless as
            the Sidonian they had sent to death. One groan broke from the Athenians. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Save, Athena! Save! It is Artemisia! The queen of Halicarnassus!”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The heavy trireme of the amazon princess was a magnificent sight as they looked on
            her. Her oars flew in a flashing rhythm. The foam leaped in a cataract over her ram. The
            sun made fire of the tossing weapons on her prow. A yell of triumph rose from the
            Phœnicians. On the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> men dropped sword and spear, moaned,
            raved, and gazed wildly on Themistocles as if he were a god possessing power to dash the
            death aside. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To your places, men!”</span> rang his shout, as he faced the foe unmoved, <span class="tei tei-q">“and die as
              Athenians!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then even while men glanced up at the sun to greet Helios for the last time, there was
            a marvel. The threatening beak shot around. The trireme flew past them, her oars leaping
            madly, her people too intent on escape even to give a flight of javelins. And again the
            Athenians cheered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            Still above them towered the tall Phœnician, but they could have scaled Mt. Caucasus at
            that instant. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Onward! Up and after them,”</span> rang Ameinias’s blast, <span class="tei tei-q">“she is our own, we will take

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The javelins and arrows were pelting from the Barbarian. The Athenians mocked the
            shower as they leaped the void from bulwark to bulwark. Vainly the Phœnicians strove to
            clear the grapples. Too firm! Their foes came on to their decks with long leaps, or here
            and there ran deftly on projecting spars, for what athlete of Hellas could not run the
            tight rope? In an instant the long rowers’ deck of the Tyrian was won, and the attackers
            cheered and blessed Athena. But this was only storming the first outpost. Like castles
            forward and aft reared the prow and poop, whither the sullen defenders retreated.
            Turning at bay, the Phœnicians swarmed back into the waist, waiting no scourging from
            their officers. Now their proud admiral himself plunged into the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mêlée</span></span>, laying about with a mighty sword worthy of Ajax at Troy, showing he was a
            prince of the Aryans indeed. It took all the steadiness of Ameinias and his stoutest men
            to stop the rush, and save the Athenians in turn from being driven overboard. The rush
            was halted finally, though this was mere respite before a fiercer breaking of the storm.
            The two ships were drifting yet closer to the strand. Only the fear of striking their
            own men kept the Persians around the king from clouding the air with arrows. Glaucon saw
            the grandees near Xerxes’s throne brandishing their swords. In imagination he saw the
            monarch leaping from his throne in agony as at Thermopylæ. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Back to the charge,”</span> pealed Ariamenes’s summons to the Tyrians; <span class="tei tei-q">“will you be
              cowards and dogs beneath the very eyes of the king?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The defenders answered with a second rush. Others again hurled darts from the stern
            and foreship. Then out of the <a name="corr325" id="corr325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">mælstrom</span> of men and weapons came a truce. Athenian and
            Tyrian drew back, whilst Themistocles and Ariamenes were fighting blade to blade. Twice
            the giant Persian almost <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dashed the Hellene down. Twice
            Themistocles recovered poise, and paid back stroke for stroke. He had smitten the helmet
            from Ariamenes’s head and was swinging for a master-blow when his foot slipped on the
            bloody plank. He staggered. Before he could recover, the Persian had brought his own
            weapon up, and flung his might into the downward stroke. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The admiral—lost!”</span> Athenians shuddered together, but with the groan shot a
            javelin. Clear through the scales of the cuirass it tore, and into the Persian’s
            shoulder,—Glaucon’s cast, never at the Isthmus truer with hand or eye. The ponderous
            blade turned, grazed the Athenian’s corselet, clattered on the deck. The Persian sprang
            back disarmed and powerless. At sight thereof the Phœnicians flung down their swords.
            True Orientals, in the fate of their chief they saw decreeing Destiny,—what use to
            resist it? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yield, my Lord, yield,”</span> called Glaucon, in Persian, <span class="tei tei-q">“the battle is against you,
              and no fault of yours. Save the lives of your men.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Ariamenes gave a toss of his princely head, and with his left hand plucked the javelin
            from his shoulder. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A prince of the Aryans knows how to die, but not how to yield,”</span> he cast back, and
            before the Athenians guessed his intent he sprang upon the bulwark. There in the sight
            of his king he stood and bowed his head and with his left arm made the sign of
            adoration. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seize him!”</span> shouted Ameinias, divining his intent, but too late. The Persian
            leaped into the water. In his heavy mail he sank like lead. The wave closed over him, as
            he passed forever from the sight of man. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was stillness on the Tyrian for a moment. A groan of helpless horror was rising
            from the Barbarians on the shore. Then the Phœnicians fell upon their knees, crying in
            their harsh tongue, <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarter! Quarter!”</span> and embracing and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kissing the feet of the victors. Thanks to the moment of quietness given
            them, the Athenians’ blood had cooled a little; they gathered up the weapons cast upon
            the deck; there was no massacre. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles mounted the poop of the captured flag-ship, and Glaucon with him. The
            wind was wafting them again into the centre of the channel. For the first time for many
            moments they were able to look about them, to ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“How goes the battle?”</span> Not the
            petty duel they had fought, but the great battle of battles which was the life-struggle
            of Hellas. And behold, as they gazed they pressed their hands upon their eyes and looked
            and looked again, for the thing they saw seemed overgood for truth. Where the great
            Barbarian line had been pushing up the strait, were only bands of scattered ships, and
            most of these turning their beaks from Salamis. The waves were strewn with wrecks, and
            nigh every one a Persian. And right, left, and centre the triumphant Hellenes were
            pressing home, ramming, grappling, capturing. Even whilst the fight raged, pinnaces were
            thrusting out from Salamis—Aristeides’s deed, they later heard—crowded with martial
            graybeards who could not look idly on while their sons fought on the ships, and who
            speedily landed on <a name="corr327" id="corr327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Psyttaleia</span> to massacre the luckless Persians there stationed. The
            cheers of the Barbarians were ended now; from the shores came only a beastlike howling
            which drowned the pæans of the victors. As the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> people
            looked, they could see the once haughty Phœnicians and Cilicians thrusting back against
            the land, and the thousands of footmen running down upon the shore to drag the shattered
            triremes up and away from the triumphant Hellenes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> people in wondering gaze stood there for a long
            time as if transfixed, forgetful how their ship and its prize drifted, forgetful of
            weariness, forgetful of wounds. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then as one man they
            turned to the poop of the captured Tyrian, and to Themistocles. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span> had done it—their admiral. He had saved Hellas under the eyes of the vaunting
            demigod who thought to be her destroyer. They called to Themistocles, they worshipped as
            if he were the Olympian himself. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hellas was saved. But whether forever or only for a year the gods kept hid.
            Panic-stricken, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the World”</span> had fled to Asia after the great disaster.
            The eunuchs, the harem women, the soft-handed pages, had escaped with their master to
            luxurious Sardis, the remnant of the fleet fled back across the Ægean. But the brain and
            right arm of the Persians, Mardonius the Valiant, remained in Hellas. With him were
            still the Median infantry, the Tartar horse-archers, the matchless Persian lancers,—the
            backbone of the undefeated army. Hellas was not yet safe. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates had prospered. He had been reëlected strategus. If Themistocles no longer
            trusted him quite so freely as once, Aristeides, restored now to much of his former
            power, gave him full confidence. Democrates found constant and honourable employment
            through the winter in the endless negotiations at Sparta, at Corinth, and elsewhere,
            while the jealous Greek states wrangled and intrigued, more to humiliate some rival than
            to advance the safety of Hellas. But amongst all the patriot chiefs none seemed more
            devoted to the common weal of Hellas than the Athenian orator. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermippus at least was convinced of this. The Eleusinian had settled at Trœzene on the
            Argive coast, a hospitable city that received many an outcast Athenian. He found his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>daughter’s resistance to another marriage increasingly
            unreasonable. Was not Glaucon dead for more than a year? Ought not any woman to bless
            Hera who gave her so noble, so eloquent, a husband as Democrates—pious, rich, trusted
            by the greatest, and with the best of worldly prospects? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            Hermippus, once, <span class="tei tei-q">“you shall not find me obstinate. Can a loving father say more? But
              if you are simply resolved never to marry, I will give you to him despite your will. A
              senseless whim must not blast your highest happiness.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione’s answer was to fly to her chamber, and to weep—as many a time before—over
            Phœnix in the cradle. Here old Cleopis found her, took her in her arms, and sang her the
            old song about Alphæus chasing Arethusa—a song more fit for Phœnix than his mother, but
            most comforting. So the contest for the moment passed, but after a conference with
            Hermippus, Democrates went away on public business to Corinth unusually well pleased
            with the world and himself. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a tedious, jangling conference held at the Isthmus city. Mardonius had tempted
            the Athenians sorely. In the spring had come his envoys proffering reparation for all
            injuries in the wars, enlarged territory, and not slavery, but free alliance with the
            Great King, if they would but join against their fellow-Hellenes. The Athenians had met
            the tempter as became Athenians. Aristeides had given the envoys the answer of the whole
            people. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We know your power. Yet tell it to Mardonius, that so long as Helios moves in the
              heavens we will not make <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>alliance with Xerxes, but
              rather trust to the gods whose temples he has burned.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Bravely said, but when the Athenians looked to Sparta for the great army to hasten
            north and give Mardonius his death-stroke, it was the old wearisome tale of excuses and
            delay. At the conference in Corinth Aristeides and Democrates had passed from arguments
            to all but threats, even such as Themistocles had used at Salamis. It was after one of
            these fruitless debates that Democrates passed out of the gathering at the Corinthian
            prytaneum, with his colleagues all breathing forth their wrath against Dorian stupidity
            and evasiveness. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates himself crossed the city Agora, seeking the house of the friendly merchant
            where he was to sup. He walked briskly, his thoughts more perhaps on the waiting
            betrothal feast at Trœzene, than on the discussion behind him. The Agora scene had
            little to interest, the same buyers, booths, and babel as in Athens, only the citadel
            above was the mount of Acro-Corinthus, not the tawny rock of Athena. And in late months
            he had begun to find his old fears and terrors flee away. Every day he was growing more
            certain that his former <span class="tei tei-q">“missteps”</span>—that was his own name for certain
            occurrences—could have no malign influence. <span class="tei tei-q">“After all,”</span> he was reflecting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nemesis is a very capricious goddess. Often she forgets for a lifetime, and after
              death—who knows what is beyond the Styx?”</span>

            of a beggar. The man was sitting on the steps between the pillars of a colonnade, with a

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates shivered. The late spring sun was warm. He felt no heat. A mere charge of
            treason he was almost prepared now to endure. If Mistress Fortune helped him, he might
            refute it, but to be branded before Hellas as the destroyer of his bosom friend, and
            that by guile the like whereof Tantalus, Sisyphus, and Ixion conjoined had never
            wrought—what wonder his knees smote together? Why had he not foreseen that Agis would
            fall into Lycon’s hands? Why had he trusted that lying tale from Artemisium? And worst
            of all, worse than the howls of the people who would tear his body asunder like dogs,
            not waiting the work of the hemlock, was the thought of Hermione. She hated him now. How
            she would love him, though he sat on Xerxes’s throne, if once her suspicion rose to
            certainty! He saw himself ruined in life and in love, and blazoned as infamous forever. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lycon was wise enough to sit some moments, letting his utterance do its work. He was
            confident, and rightly. Democrates looked on him at last. The workings of the Athenian’s
            face were terrible. </p>

            unfold themselves in due place and time. Suffice it here, that when he let the Athenian
            go his way Lycon was convinced that Democrates had bound himself heart and soul to
            forward his enterprise. The orator was no merry guest for his Corinthian hosts that
            night. He returned to his old manner of drinking unmixed wine. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thirsty as a

            They did not know that once more the chorus of the Furies was singing about his ears,
            and he could not still it by the deepest wine-cup. They did not know that every time he
            closed his eyes he was seeing the face of Glaucon. That morning he had mocked at
            Nemesis. That night he heard the beating of her brazen wings. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Despite exile, life had moved pleasantly for Hermippus’s household that spring. The
            Trœzenians had surpassed all duties to Zeus Xenios—the stranger’s god—in entertaining
            the outcast Athenians. The fugitives had received two obols per day to keep them in figs
            and porridge. Their children had been suffered to roam and plunder the orchards. But
            Hermippus had not needed such generosity. He had placed several talents at interest in
            Corinth; likewise bonds of <span class="tei tei-q">“guest-friendship”</span> with prominent Trœzenians made his
            residence very agreeable. He had hired a comfortable house, and could enjoy even luxury
            with his wife, daughter, young sons, and score of slaves. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Little Phœnix grew marvellously day by day, as if obeying his mother’s command to wax
            strong and avenge his father. Old Cleopis vowed he was the healthiest, least tearful
            babe, as well as the handsomest, she had ever known,—and she spoke from wide
            experience. When he was one year old, he was so active they had to tie him in the
            cradle. When the golden spring days came, he would ride forth upon his nurse’s back,
            surveying the Hellas he was born to inherit, and seeming to find it exceeding good. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But as spring verged on summer, Hermione demanded so much of Cleopis’s care that even
            Phœnix ceased to be the focus of attention. The lordly Alcmæonid fell into the cus<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tody of one Niobe, a dark-haired lass of the islands, who
            treated him well, but cared too much for certain young <span class="tei tei-q">“serving-gentlemen”</span> to waste
            on her charge any unreciprocated adoration. So on one day, just as the dying grass told
            the full reign of the Sun King, she went forth with her precious bundle wriggling in her
            arms, but her thoughts hardly on Master Phœnix. Procles the steward had been cold of
            late, he had even cast sly glances at Jocasta, Lysistra’s tiring-woman. Mistress Niobe
            was ready—since fair means of recalling the fickle Apollo failed—to resort to foul.
            Instead, therefore, of going to the promenade over the sea, she went—burden and all—to
            the Agora, where she was sure old Dion, who kept a soothsayer’s shop, would give due
            assistance in return for half a drachma. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The market was just thinning. Niobe picked her way amongst the vegetable women, fought
            off a boy who thrust on her a pair of geese, and found in a quiet corner by a temple
            porch the booth of Dion, who grinned with his toothless gums in way of greeting. He
            listened with paternal interest to her story, soothed her when she sniffled at Procles’s
            name, and made her show her silver, then began pulling over his bags and vials of
            strange powders and liquids. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, kind Master Dion,”</span> began Niobe, for the sixth time, <span class="tei tei-q">“if only some philtre

            <span class="tei tei-q">“But, of course, we must use only consecrated corn, that’s two obols more.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philotata</span></span>,”</span> said Dion, kindly but firmly, <span class="tei tei-q">“we had

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Niobe wept. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ai!</span></span> woe. <span class="tei tei-q">‘A little longer’</span> and Jocasta has

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Two round tears did not move Dion in the slightest. Niobe was sobbing, at her small
            wits’ end, when a voice sounded behind her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What’s there wrong, lass? By Zeus, but you carry a handsome child!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Niobe glanced, and instantly stopped weeping. A young man dressed roughly as a sailor,
            and with long black hair and beard, had approached her, but despite dress and beard she
            was quite aware he was far handsomer than even Procles. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I beg pardon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>,”</span>—she said <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>”</span> by instinct,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I’m only an honest maid.

            susceptible seaman, but to her disgust she saw he was admiring only the babe, not
            herself. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! Gods and goddesses, what a beautiful child! A girl?”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“A boy,”</span> answered Niobe, almost sullenly. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hermippus?”</span> The stranger seemed to catch the word out of Dion’s mouth. A donkey
            had broken loose at the upper end of the Agora; he turned and stared at it and its
            pursuers intently. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If you’re Athenian,”</span> went on the soothsayer, <span class="tei tei-q">“the story’s an old one—of Glaucon

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stranger turned back again. For a moment Dion saw he was blinking, but no doubt it
            was dust. Then he suddenly began to fumble in his girdle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want, girl?”</span> he demanded of Niobe, nigh fiercely. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Two obols.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Take two drachmæ. I was once a friend to that Glaucon, and traitor though he has been

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Without waiting her answer he thrust the coin into her hands, and caught the child out
            of them. Phœnix looked up into the strange, bearded face, and deliberated an instant
            whether to crow or to weep. Then some friendly god decided him. He laughed as sweetly,
            as musically, as ever one can at his most august age. With both chubby hands he plucked
            at the black beard and held tight. The strange sailor answered laugh with laugh, and
            released himself right gayly. Then whilst Niobe and Dion watched and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wondered they saw the sailor kiss the child full fifty times,
            all the time whispering soft words in his ear, at which Phœnix crowed and laughed yet
            more. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“An old family servant,”</span> threw out Dion, in a whisper. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sheep!”</span> retorted the nurse, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you call yourself wise? Do you think a man with
              that face and those long hands ever felt the stocks or the whip? He’s gentleman born,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“War makes many changes,”</span> rejoined Dion. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ai!</span></span> is he beside

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stranger indeed had seemed to forget them all and was going with swift strides up
            the Agora, but just before Niobe could begin her outcry he wheeled, and brought his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Once more the Persians pressed into Attica, once more the Athenians,—or such few of
            them as had ventured home in the winter,—fled with their movables to Salamis or
            Peloponnesus, and an embassy, headed by Aristeides, hastened to Sparta to demand for the
            last time that the tardy ephors make good their promise in sending forth their infantry
            to hurl back the invader. If not, Aristeides spoke plainly, his people must perforce
            close alliance with Mardonius. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Almost to the amazement of the Athenian chiefs, so accustomed were they to Dorian
            doltishness and immobility, after a ten days’ delay and excuses that <span class="tei tei-q">“they must
              celebrate their festival the Hyacinthia,”</span> the ephors called forth their whole levy.
            Ten thousand heavy infantrymen with a host of lightly armed <span class="tei tei-q">“helots”</span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> were started northward under the able
            lead of Pausanias, the regent for Leonidas’s young son. Likewise all the allies of
            Lacedæmon—Corinthians, Sicyonians, Elians, Arcadians—began to hurry toward the
            Isthmus. Therefore men who had loved Hellas and had almost despaired for her took
            courage. <span class="tei tei-q">“At last we will have a great land battle, and an end to the Barbarian.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All was excitement in the Athenian colony at Trœzene. The board of strategi met and
            voted that now was the time <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for a crowning effort. Five
            thousand men-at-arms should march under Aristeides to join against Mardonius in Bœotia.
            By sea Themistocles should go with every available ship to Delos, meet the allied
            squadrons there, and use his infallible art in persuading the sluggish Spartan high
            admiral to conduct a raid across the Ægean at Xerxes’s own doors. Of the ten strategi
            Democrates had called loudest for instant action, so loudly indeed that Themistocles had
            cautioned him against rashness. Hermippus was old, but experienced men trusted him,
            therefore he was appointed to command the contingent of his tribe. Democrates was to
            accompany Aristeides as general adjutant; his diplomatic training would be invaluable in
            ending the frictions sure to arise amongst the allies. Cimon would go with Themistocles,
            and so every other man was sent to his place. In the general preparation private
            problems seemed forgotten. Hermippus and Democrates both announced that the betrothal of
            Hermione had been postponed, pending the public crisis. The old Eleusinian had not told
            his daughter, or even his wife, why he had seemed to relax his announced purpose of
            forcing Hermione to an unwelcome marriage. The young widow knew she had respite—for
            how long nothing told her, but for every day her agony was postponed she blessed kind
            Hera. Then came the morning when her father must go forth with his men. She still loved
            him, despite the grief he was giving her. She did him justice to believe he acted in
            affection. The gay ribbons that laced his cuirass, the red and blue embroidery that
            edged his <span class="tei tei-q">“taxiarch’s”</span> cloak, were from the needle of his daughter. Hermione kissed
            him as she stood with her mother in the aula. He coughed gruffly when he answered their
              <span class="tei tei-q">“farewell.”</span> The house door closed behind him, and Hermione and Lysistra ran into
            one another’s arms. They had given to Hellas their best, and now must look to Athena. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span>
          <a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermippus and Aristeides were gone, Democrates remained in Trœzene. His business, he
            said, was more diplomatic than military, and he was expecting advices from the islands
            which he must take to Pausanias in person. He had a number of interviews with
            Themistocles, when it was observed that every time he came away with clouded brow and
            gruff answers to all who accosted. It began to be hinted that all was not as well as
            formerly between the admiral and the orator, that Democrates had chosen to tie too
            closely to Aristeides for the son of Neocles’s liking, and that as soon as the campaign
            was decided, a bitter feud would break out betwixt them. But this was merest gossip.
            Outwardly Democrates and Themistocles continued friends, dined together, exchanged
            civilities. On the day when Themistocles was to sail for Delos he walked arm in arm with
            Democrates to the quay. The hundreds of onlookers saw him embrace the young strategus in
            a manner belying any rumour of estrangement, whilst Democrates stood on the sand waving
            his good wishes until the admiral climbed the ladder of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was another day and landscape which the stranger in Hellas would have remembered
            long. The haven of Trœzene, noblest in Peloponnesus, girt by its two mountain
            promontories, Methana and the holy hill Calauria, opened its bright blue into the deeper
            blue of the Saronic bay. Under the eye of the beholder Ægina and the coasts of Attica
            stood forth, a fit frame to the far horizon. Sun, sea, hills, and shore wrought together
            to make one glorious harmony, endless variety, yet ordered and fashioned into a divine
            whole. <span class="tei tei-q">“Euopis,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Fair-Faced,”</span> the beauty-loving dwellers of the country called it, and they
            named aright. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Something of the beauty touched even Hermione as she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stood on the hill slope, gazing across the sea. Only Cleopis was with her. The young
            widow had less trembling when she looked on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> than
            when one year before the stately trireme had sailed for Artemisium. If ill news must
            come, it would be from the plains of Bœotia. Most of Themistocles’s fleet was already at
            Delos. He led only a dozen sail. When his squadron glided on into the blue deep, the
            haven seemed deserted save for the Carthaginian trader that swung at her cables close
            upon the land. As Hermione looked and saw the climbing sun change the tintings of the
            waters, here spreading a line of green gold amidst the blue, here flashing the waves
            with dark violet, something of the peace and majesty of the scene entered into her own
            breast. The waves at the foot of the slope beat in monotonous music. She did not wonder
            that Thetis, Galatea, and all the hundred Nereids loved their home. Somewhere, far off
            on that shimmering plain, Glaucon the Beautiful had fallen asleep; whether he waked in
            the land of Rhadamanthus, whether he had been stolen away by Leucothea and the other
            nymphs to be their playfellow, she did not know. She was not sad, even to think of him
            crowned with green seaweed, and sitting under the sea-floor with fish-tailed Tritons at
            their tables of pearl, while the finny shoals like birds flitted above their heads.
            Thales the Sage made all life proceed out of the sea. Perchance all life should return
            to it. Then she would find her husband again, not beyond, but within the realms of great
            Oceanus. With such beauty spreading out before her eyes the phantasy was almost welcome. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The people had wandered homeward. Cleopis set the parasol on the dry grass where it
            would shade her mistress and betook herself to the shelter of a rock. If Hermione was
            pleased to meditate so long, she would not deny her slave a siesta. So the Athenian sat
            and mused, now sadly, now <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with a gleam of brightness,
            for she was too young to have her sun clouded always. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A speaker near by her called her out of her reverie. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You sit long, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyria</span></span>, and gaze forth as if you were Zeus in

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione had not exchanged a word with Democrates since that day she cast scorn on him
            on that other hill slope at Munychia, but this did not make his intrusion more welcome.
            With mortification she realized that she had forgotten herself. That she lay on the
            sunny bank with her feet outstretched and her hair shaken loose on her shoulders. Her
            feet she instantly covered with her long himation. Her hands flew instantly to her hair.
            Then she uprose, flushing haughtily. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It has pleased my father, sir,”</span> she spoke with frigid dignity, <span class="tei tei-q">“to tell me that
              you are some day perchance to be my husband. The fulfilment lies with the gods. But
              to-day the strategus Democrates knows our customs too well to thrust himself upon an
              Attic gentlewoman who finds herself alone save for one servant.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyria</span></span>; pardon the word, it’s overcold; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">makaira</span></span>, I’d say more gladly,”</span> Democrates was marvellously at his ease
            despite her frowns, <span class="tei tei-q">“your noble father will take nothing amiss if I ask you to sit
              again that we may talk together.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not think so.”</span> Hermione drew herself up at full height. But Democrates
            deliberately placed himself in the path up the hillside. To have run toward the water
            seemed folly. She could expect no help from Cleopis, who would hardly oppose a man soon
            probably to be her master. As the less of evils, Hermione did not indeed sit as desired,
            but stood facing her unloved lover and hearkening. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“How long I’ve desired this instant!”</span> Democrates looked as if he might seize her
            hands to kiss them, but she thrust <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them behind her. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know you hate me bitterly because, touching your late husband, I did my duty.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your duty?”</span> Nestor’s eloquence was in her incredulous echo. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If I have pained you beyond telling, do you think my act was a pleasant one for me? A

              infinite sorrow to her I love?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I hardly understand.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates drew a step nearer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite the Golden—by what name shall I call my goddess?”</span>
            Hermione drew back a step. There was danger in his eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have loved you, loved you
              long. Before Glaucon took you in marriage I loved you. But Eros and Hymen hearkened to
              his prayers, not mine. You became his bride. I wore a bright face at your wedding. You
              remember I was Glaucon’s groomsman, and rode beside you in the bridal car. You loved
              him, he seemed worthy of you. Therefore I trod my own grief down into my heart, and
              rejoiced with my friends. But to cease loving you I could not. Truly they say Eros is
              the strongest god, and pitiless—do not the poets say bloody Ares begat him—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spare me mythologies,”</span> interposed Hermione, with another step back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“As you will, but you shall hearken. I have desired this moment for two years. Not as
              the weak girl given by her father, but as the fair goddess who comes to me gladly, I
              do desire you. And I know you will smile on me when you have heard me through.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Keep back your eloquence. You have destroyed Glaucon. That is enough.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear me.”</span> Democrates cried desperately now. Her<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mione feared even to retreat farther, lest he pass to violence. She summoned courage
            and looked him in the eye. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Say on, then. But remember I am a woman and alone save for Cleopis. If you profess to
              love me, you will not forget that.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Democrates was passing almost beyond the limits of coherent speech. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, when you come to me, you will not know what a price I have paid for you. In
              Homer’s day men wooed their wives with costly gifts, but I—have I not paid for you
              with my soul? My soul, I say—honour, friendship, country, what has weighed against
              Himeros, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Master Desire,’</span>—the desire ever for you!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She hardly understood him, his speech flowed so thick. She knew he was on the edge of
            reason, and feared to answer lest she drive beyond it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you hear the price I have paid? Do you still look on in cold hate, lady? Ah, by
              Zeus, even in your coldest, most forbidding mood you are fair as the Paphian when she
              sprang above the sea! And I will win you, lady, I will win your heart, for they shall
              do you homage, even all Athens, and I will make you a queen. Yes! the house of Athena
              on the Acropolis shall be your palace if you will, and they will cry in the Agora, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Way, way for Hermione, glorious consort of Democrates our king!’</span> ”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> spoke Hermione, while her hands grew chill, for now she was sure he raved,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not the joy to comprehend. There is no king in Athens, please Athena, there
              never will be. Treason and blasphemy you speak all in one.”</span> She sought vainly with
            her eyes for refuge. None in sight. The hill slope seemed empty save for the scattered
            brown boulders. Far away a goat was wandering. She motioned to Cleopis. The old woman
            was staring now, and doubtless <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thought Democrates was
            carrying his familiarities too far, but she was a weak creature, and at best could only
            scream. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Treason and blasphemy,”</span> cried Democrates, dropping on his knees, his frame shaking
            with dishonest passion, <span class="tei tei-q">“yes! call them so now. They will be blessed truth for me in a
              month, for me, for you. Hermes the Trickster is a mighty god. He has befriended Eros.
              I shall possess Athens and possess you. I shall be the most fortunate mortal upon
              earth as now I am most miserable. Ah! but I have waited so long.”</span> He sprang to his
            feet. <span class="tei tei-q">“Tarry, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">makaira</span></span>, tarry! A kiss!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione screamed at last shrilly and turned to fly. Instantly Democrates was upon
            her. In that fluttering white dress escape was hopeless. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Apollo pursuing Daphne!”</span>—his crazed shout as his arms closed around her,—<span class="tei tei-q">“but
              Daphne becomes no laurel this time. Her race is lost. She shall pay the forfeit.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She felt him seize her girdle. He swung her face to face. She saw his wide eyes, his
            mad smile. His hot breath smote her cheek. Cleopis at last was screaming. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mine,”</span> he triumphed, while he forced her resisting head to his own, <span class="tei tei-q">“there is
              none to hinder!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But even while the woman’s flesh crept back at his impure kiss, a giant power came
            rending the twain apart. A man had sundered them, sprung from the ground or from heaven
            belike, or from behind a boulder? He tore Democrates’s hands away as a lion tears a
            lamb. He dashed the mad orator prone upon the sod, and kicked him twice, as of mingled
            hatred and contempt. All this Hermione only knew in half, while her senses swam. Then
            she came to herself enough to see that the stranger was a young man in a sailor’s loose
            dress, his features almost hidden under the dishevelled hair and beard. All this time he
            uttered no word, but having smitten <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Democrates down,
            leaped back, rubbing his hands upon his thigh, as if despising to touch so foul an
            object. The orator groaned, staggered upward. He wore a sword. It flew from its scabbard
            as he leaped on the sailor. The stranger put forth his hand, snatched his opponent’s
            wrist, and with lightning dexterity sent the blade spinning back upon the grass. Then he
            threw Democrates a second time, and the latter did not rise again hastily, but lay
            cursing. The fall had not been gentle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But all this while Cleopis was screaming. People were hastening up the
            hill,—fishermen from a skiff upon the beach, slaves who had been carrying bales to the
            haven. In a moment they would be surrounded by a dozen. The strange sailor turned as if
            to fly. He had not spoken one word. Hermione herself at last called to him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My preserver! Your name! Blessed be you forever!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fisherfolk were very close. Cleopis was still screaming. The sailor looked once
            into the lady’s eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am nameless! You owe me nothing!”</span> And with that he was gone up the hill slopes,
            springing with long bounds that would have mocked pursuing, had any attempted. But
            Cleopis quenched her outcry instantly; her screams had been drowned by a louder scream
            from Hermione, who fell upon the greensward, no marble whiter than her face. The nurse
            ran to her mistress. Democrates staggered to his feet. Whatever else the chastisement
            had given him, it had restored his balance of mind. He told the fisherfolk a glib story
            that a sailor wandering along the strand had accosted Hermione, that he himself had
            chased the villain off, but had tripped whilst trying to follow. If the tale was not of
            perfect workmanship at all points, there was no one with interest to gainsay it. A few
            ran up the hill slope, but the sailor was nowhere in sight. Hermione was still
            speechless. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>They made a litter of oars and sail-cloth
            and carried her to her mother. Democrates oiled Cleopis’s palm well, that she should
            tell nothing amiss to Lysistra. It was a long time before Hermione opened her eyes in
            her chamber. Her first words were:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon! I have seen Glaucon!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You have had a strange dream, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philotata</span></span>,”</span> soothed Lysistra,
            shifting the pillows, <span class="tei tei-q">“lie still and rest.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Hermione shook her shining brown head and repeated, many times:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No dream! No dream! I have seen Glaucon face to face. In that instant he spoke and
              looked on me I knew him. He lives. He saved me. Ah! why does he stay away?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lysistra, whose husband had not deemed it prudent to inform her of Themistocles’s
            revelations, was infinitely distressed. She sent for the best physicians of the city,
            and despatched a slave to the temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus—not distant—to
            sacrifice two cocks for her daughter’s recovery. The doctors looked wise and recommended
            heavy doses of spiced wine, and if those did not suffice, said that the patient might
            spend a night in the temple of the Healer, who would no doubt explain the true remedy in
            a dream. A <span class="tei tei-q">“wise woman”</span> who had great following among the slaves advised that a
            young puppy be tied upon Hermione’s temples to absorb the disaffection of her brain.
            Lysistra was barely persuaded not to follow her admonitions. After a few days the
            patient grew better, recovered strength, took an interest in her child. Yet ever and
            anon she would repeat over Phœnix’s cradle:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your father lives! I have seen him! I have seen him!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What, however, puzzled Lysistra most, was the fact that Cleopis did not contradict her
            young mistress in the least, but maintained a mysterious silence about the whole
            adventure. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The night after his adventure on the hill slope Democrates received in his chambers no
            less an individual than Hiram. That industrious Phœnician had been several days in
            Trœzene, occupied in a manner he and his superior discreetly kept to themselves. The
            orator had a bandage above one eye, where a heavy sandal had kicked him. He was
            exceedingly pale, and sat in the arm-chair propped with pillows. That he had awaited
            Hiram eagerly, betrayed itself by the promptness with which he cut short the inevitable
            salaam. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The person Hiram escorted into the room proved to be no more nor less than Lampaxo.
            Two years had not removed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the wrinkles from her cheek,
            the sharpness from her nose, the rasping from her tongue. At sight of her Democrates
            half rose from his seat and held out his hand affably, the demagogue’s instinct
            uppermost. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            dirty chiton. Such condescension on the part of a magnate barely less than Themistocles
            or Aristeides was overpowering. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Poorly? I grieve to learn it. I was informed that he was comfortably settled here

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>, certainly,”</span> gasped Lampaxo, and so she
            began a recital mingled with many moans and protestations, which Democrates dared not
            bid her hasten. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The good woman commenced by reminding the strategus how he had visited her and her
            brother Polus to question them as to the doings of the Babylonish carpet merchant, and
            how it had seemed plain to them that Glaucon was nothing less than a traitor. Next she
            proceeded to relate how her husband had enabled the criminal to fly by sea, and her own
            part therein—for she loudly accused herself of treason in possessing a guilty knowledge
            of the outlaw’s manner of escape. As for Bias, he had just now gone on a message to
            Megara, but Democrates would surely castigate his own slave. <span class="tei tei-q">“Still,”</span> wound up
            Lampaxo, <span class="tei tei-q">“the traitor seemed drowned, and his treason locked up in Phorcys’s strong

              the cellar. All the time the sailor barely spoke a few words of island Doric, but my
              heart misgave. He seemed so refined, so handsome. And near the roots of his hair it
              was not so dark—as if dyed and needing renewal. Trust a woman’s eyes for that. When

              reasonably you will grant—only half a minæ for the winter. I gave the stranger a fine
              pillow and a blanket embroidered by Stephanium, she was my great-aunt, and left it to
              me by will, and the beautiful red wool was from Byzantium—”</span>

              wine. Then I went up the ladder. O Mother Demeter, how sharply I listened, but the
              rascals spoke too low together for me to catch anything, save that Critias had dropped
              his Doric and spoke good Attic now. At last Phormio came up to me, and I pretended to
              snore. In the morning, lo! the scoundrelly stranger had slipped away. In the evening
              he returns late. Phormio harbours him again. So for several nights, coming late, going
              early. Then to-night he comes a bit before his wont. He and Phormio drank more than

              Phormio was sleeping snug beside me, I went down the ladder, intending to call the

            rings, his smooth brown skin and beady eyes. The door turned on its pivots—closed.
            Democrates heard the retiring footsteps. No doubt the Phœnician was taking Lampaxo with
            him. The Athenian staggered across the room to his bed and flung himself on it, laughing
            hysterically. How absolutely his enemy was delivered into his hands! How the Moræ in
            sending that Carthaginian ship, to do Lycon’s business and his, had provided the means
            of ridding him of the haunting terror! How everything conspired to aid him! He need not
            even kill Glaucon. He would have no blood guiltiness, he need not dread Alecto and her
            sister Furies. He could trust Hiram and Hasdrubal to see to it that Glaucon never re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>turned to plague him. And Hermione? Democrates laughed
            again. He was almost frightened at his own glee. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus he lay a long time, while the drip, drip from the water-clock in the corner told

            a black Carthaginian sailor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with a dirk a cubit long.
            Democrates did not even ask for a lantern. None of the servants could fathom their
            master’s doings of late. He gave strappings when they asked questions, and Bias was
            away. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The streets of Trœzene were utterly deserted when Democrates threaded them. There was
            no moon, neither he nor his companion were overcertain of the way. Once they missed the
            right turn, wandered down a blind alley, and plunged into a pile of offal awaiting the
            scavenger dogs. But finally the seaman stopped at a low door in a narrow street, and a
            triple rap made it open. The scene was squalid. A rush-candle was burning on a table.
            Around it squatted seven men who rose and bowed as the strategus entered. In the dim
            flicker he could just recognize the burly shipmaster Hasdrubal and gigantic Hib, the
            Libyan <span class="tei tei-q">“governor,”</span> whose ebon face betrayed itself even there. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We have expected you, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>,”</span> said Hiram, who was one of
            the group. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks be to Hermes and to you all. I have told my guide already I will be grateful.
              Where is he?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“In the kitchen behind, your Lordship. We were singularly favoured. Hib had the cord
              around his arms before he wakened. He could scarcely struggle despite his power. The
              fishmonger awoke before Hasdrubal could nip him. For a moment we feared his outcries
              would rouse the street. But again the gods blessed us. No one stirred, and we soon
              throttled him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Take the light,”</span> ordered Democrates. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Accompanied by Hiram, the orator entered the kitchen, a small square room. The
            white-washed ceiling was blacked around the smoke-hole, a few pots and pans lay in the
            corners, a few dying embers gleamed on the hearth. But Democrates had eyes only for two
            objects,—human figures tightly bound lying rigid as <a name="corr368" id="corr368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">faggots</span> in the further corner. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span>
          <a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Which is he?”</span> asked Democrates again, stepping softly as though going to danger. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The further one is Phormio, the nearer is my Lord’s enemy. Your Excellency need not
              fear to draw close. He is quite secure.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me the candle.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates held the light high and trod gently over to the prostrate men. Hiram spoke
            rightly that his victim was secure. They had lashed him hand and foot, using small
            chains in lieu of cords. A bit of wood had been thrust into his mouth and tied with
            twine under the ears. Democrates stood an instant looking down, then very deliberately
            knelt beside the prisoner and moved the candle closer. He could see now the face hidden
            half by the tangled black hair and beard and the gag—but who could doubt it?—the deep
            blue eye, the chiselled profile, the small, fine lips, yes, and the godlike form visible
            in its comeliness despite the bands. He was gazing upon the man who two years ago had
            called him <span class="tei tei-q">“bosom-friend.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The prisoner looked straight upward. The only thing he could move was his eyes, and
            these followed Democrates’s least motion. The orator pressed the candle closer yet. He
            even put out his hand, and touched the face to brush away the hair. A long look—and he
            was satisfied. No mistake was possible. Democrates arose and stood over the prisoner,
            then spoke aloud. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon, I have played at dice with Fortune. I have conquered. I did not ruin you
              willingly. There was no other way. A man must first be a friend to himself, and then
              friendly to others. I have cast in my lot with the Persians. It was I who wrote that
              letter which blasted you at Colonus. Very soon there will be a great battle fought in
              Bœotia. Lycon and I will make it certain that Mardonius <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conquers. I am to be tyrant of Athens. Hermione shall be my wife.”</span>
            The workings of the prisoner’s face made Democrates wince; from Glaucon’s throat came
            rattlings, his eyes were terrible. But the other drove recklessly forward. <span class="tei tei-q">“As for
              you, you pass this night out of my life. How you escaped the sea I know not and care
              less. Hasdrubal will take you to Carthage, and sell you into the interior of Libya. I
              wish you no misery, only you go where you shall never see Hellas again. I am merciful.
              Your life is in my hands. But I restore it. I am without blood guiltiness. What I have
              done you would have done, had you loved as I—had you been under necessity as I. Eros
              is a great god, but Anangkë, Dame Necessity, is yet mightier. So to-night we
              part—farewell.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A strong spasm passed through the prisoner’s frame. For a moment Democrates thought
            the bonds would snap. Too strong. The orator swung on his heel and returned to the outer
            room. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The night wanes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kyrie</span></span>,”</span> remarked Hasdrubal; <span class="tei tei-q">“if these
              good people are to be taken to the ship, it must be soon.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“As you will. I do nothing more concerning them.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fetch down the woman,”</span> ordered Hasdrubal; in the mongrel Greek current amongst
            Mediterranean sea-folk. Two of his seamen ascended the ladder and returned with Lampaxo,
            who smirked and simpered at sight of Democrates and bobbed him a courtesy. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The traitor is seized, your Excellency. I hope your Excellency will see that he
              drinks hemlock. You will be merciful to my poor husband, even if he must be arrested
              for the night. Gods and goddesses! what are these men doing to me?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A stalwart Carthaginian was in the act of knotting a cord <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>around the good woman’s arms preparatory to pinioning them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kyrie! kyrie!</span></span>”</span> she screamed, <span class="tei tei-q">“they are binding me, too!
              Me—the most loyal woman in Attica.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates scowled and turned his back on her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Lordship surely intended this woman to be taken also,”</span> suggested Hiram,
            sweetly. <span class="tei tei-q">“It cannot be he will leave such a dangerous witness at large.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Of course not. Off with her!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kyrie! kyrie!</span></span>”</span> was her shriek, but quickly ended, for
            Hasdrubal knitted his fingers around her throat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A gag,”</span> he ordered, and with a few more struggles Lampaxo stood helpless and
            silent. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A little later the band was threading its stealthy way down the black streets. Four of
            the Carthaginians carried Glaucon, slung hands and feet over a pole. They dared not
            trust him on his feet. Phormio and Lampaxo walked, closely pinioned and pricked on by
            the captain’s dagger. They were soon at the deserted strand, and their ship’s pinnace
            lay upon the beach. Democrates accompanied them as far as the dark marge, and watched
            while the boat glided out into the gloom of the haven. The orator paced homeward alone.
            Everything had favoured him. He had even cleared himself of the curse of the Furies and
            the pursuit of Nemesis. He had, he congratulated himself, shown marvellous qualities of
            mercy. Glaucon lived? Yes—but the parching sand-plains of Libya would be as fast a
            prison as the grave, and the life of a slave in Africa was a short one. Glaucon had
            passed from his horizon forever. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Even whilst the boat pulled out to the trader, Hiram suggested that since his
            superior’s <span class="tei tei-q">“unfortunate scruples”</span> forbade them to shed blood, at least they could
            disable the most dangerous captive by putting out his eyes. But Hasdrubal, thrifty
            Semite, would not hearken. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not the fellow worth five hundred shekels in the Carthage market?—but who will

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And once at the ship the prisoners were stowed in the hold so securely that even Hiram
            ceased to concern himself. In the morning some of the neighbours indeed wondered at
            Phormio’s closed door and the silence of the jangling voice of Lampaxo; but the
            fishmonger was after all an exile, and might have returned suddenly to Attica, now the
            Persians had retreated again to Bœotia, and before these surmises could change to
            misdoubting, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> was bearing forth into the Ægean. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The business of Hasdrubal with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> at Trœzene appeared
            simple. The war had disturbed the Greek harvests. He had come accordingly with a cargo
            of African corn, and was taking a light return lading of olive oil and salt fish. But
            those who walked along the harbour front remarked that the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>
            was hardly a common merchantman. She was a <span class="tei tei-q">“sea-mouse,”</span> long, shallow, and very
            fast under sail; she also carried again an unwontedly heavy crew. When <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hasdrubal’s cargo seemed completed, he lingered a couple of
            days, alleging he was repairing a cable; then the third morning after his nocturnal
            adventure a cipher letter to Democrates sent the Carthaginian to sea. The letter went
            thus:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Lycon, in the camp of the Greeks in Bœotia, to Democrates in Trœzene,
              greeting:—The armies have now faced many days. The soothsayers declare that the
              aggressor is sure to be defeated, still there has been some skirmishing in which your
              Athenians slew Masistes, Mardonius’s chief of cavalry. This, however, is no great loss
              to us. Your presence with Aristeides is now urgently needed. Send Hasdrubal and Hiram
              at once to Asia with the papers we arranged in Corinth. Come yourself with speed to
              the army. Ten days and this merry dice-throwing is ended. </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Chaire!</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates immediately after this gave Hiram a small packet of papyrus sheets rolled
            very tight, with the ominous injunction to <span class="tei tei-q">“conceal carefully, weight it with lead,
              and fling it overboard if there is danger of capture.”</span> At which Hiram bowed more
            elegantly than usual and answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear not; it shall be guarded as the priests guard
              the ark of Moloch, and when next your slave comes, it is to salute my Lord as the
              sovran of Athens.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hiram smiled fulsomely and departed. An hour later the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>
            ran out on the light wind around the point of Calauria and into the sparkling sea to
            eastward. Democrates stood gazing after her until she was a dark speck on the horizon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The speck at last vanished. The strategus walked homeward. Glaucon was gone. The
            fateful packet binding Democrates irrevocably to the Persian cause was gone. He could
            not turn back. At the gray of morning with a few servants he quitted Trœzene, and
            hastened to join Aristeides and Pausanias in Bœotia. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the hold of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>, where Hasdrubal had stowed his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unwilling passengers, there crept just enough sunlight to
            make darkness visible. The gags had been removed from the prisoners, suffering them to
            eat, whereupon Lampaxo had raised a truly prodigious outcry which must needs be silenced
            by a vigorous anointing with Hasdrubal’s whip of bullock’s hide. Her husband and Glaucon
            disdained to join a clamour which could never escape the dreary cavern of the hold, and
            which only drew the hoots of their unmagnanimous guardians. The Carthaginians had not
            misinterpreted Glaucon’s silence, however. They knew well they had a Titan in custody,
            and did not even unlash his hands. His feet and Phormio’s were tied between two beams in
            lieu of stocks. The giant Hib took it upon himself to feed them bean porridge with a
            wooden spoon, making the dainty sweeter with tales of the parching heats of Africa and
            the life of a slave under Libyan task-masters. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So one day, another, and another, while the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> rocked at
            anchor, and the prisoners knew that liberty lay two short cable lengths away, yet might
            have been in Atlantis for all it profited them. Phormio never reviled his wife as the
            author of their calamity, and Lampaxo, with nigh childish earnestness, would protest
            that surely Democrates knew not what the sailors did when they bound her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“So noble a patriot! An evil god bewitched him into letting these harpies take us.

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To which plaint the others only smiled horribly and ground their teeth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Phormio as well as Glaucon had heard the avowal of Democrates on the night of the
            seizure. There was no longer any doubt of the answer to the great riddle. But
            disheartening, benumbing beyond all personal anguish was the dread for Hellas. The
            sacrifice at Thermopylæ vain. The glory of Salamis vain. Hellas and Athens enslaved. The
            will of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Xerxes and Mardonius accomplished not because
            of their valour, but because of their enemies’ infamy. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O gods, if indeed there be gods!”</span> Glaucon was greatly doubting that at last; <span class="tei tei-q">“if
              ye have any power, if justice, truth, and honour weigh against iniquity, put that
              power forth, or never claim the prayers and sacrifice of men again.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon was past dreading for himself. He prayed that Hermione might be spared a long
            life of tears, and that Artemis might slay her quickly by her silent arrows. To follow
            his thoughts in all their dark mazes were profitless. Suffice it that the night which
            had brooded over his soul from the hour he fled from Colonus was never so dark as now.
            He was too despairing even to curse. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The last hope fled when they heard the rattling of the cables weighing anchor. Soon
            the soft slap of the water around the bow and the regular heaving motion told that the
              <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> was under way. The sea-mouse creaked and groaned through
            all her timbers and her lading. The foul bilge-water made the hold stifling as a
            charnel-house. Lampaxo, Hib being absent, began to howl and moan. </p>

            not speedily die, at least he would soon go mad, and that would rescue him from his most

            Hasdrubal’s commission was to fetch Samos, where the still formidable fleet of the
            Barbarian lay, and to put the precious packet from Democrates in the hands of Tigranes,
            Xerxes’s commander-in-chief on the coast of Asia Minor. But although speed had been
            enjoined, the voyage did not go prosperously. Off Belbina the wind deserted them
            altogether, and Hasdrubal had been compelled to force his craft along by
            sweeps,—ponderous oars, worked by three men,—but his progress at best was slow. Off
            Cythnos the breeze had again arisen, but it was the Eurus from the southeast, worse than
            useless; the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> had been obliged to ride at anchor off the
            island for two days. Then another calm; and at last, <span class="tei tei-q">“because,”</span> said Hasdrubal
            piously, <span class="tei tei-q">“he had vowed two black lambs to the Wind God,”</span> the breeze came clear and
            cool from the north, which, if not wholly favourable, enabled the merchantman to plough
            onward. It was the fifth day, finally, after quitting Trœzene, that the headlands of
            Naxos came in sight at dawn, and the master began to take comfort. The fleet of the
            Greeks—a fisherboat had told him—was swinging inactive at Delos well to the north and
            westward, and he could fairly consider himself in waters dominated by the king. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A fortunate voyage,”</span> the master was boasting to Hiram, as he sat at breakfast in

              return cargo, and last but not least the three slaves.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“You see, my dear Hiram,”</span> quoth the master, betwixt two unwontedly huge mouthfuls,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“you see what folly it was of you to suggest putting out that handsome fellow’s
              eyes. I am strongly thinking of selling him not to Carthage, but to Babylon. I know a
              trader at Ephesus who makes a specialty of handsome youths. The satrap Artabozares has
              commissioned him to find as many good-looking out-runners as possible. Also for his
              harem—if this Glaucon were only a eunuch—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hiram, breaking a large disk of bread, was smiling very suggestively before making
            reply, when a sailor shouted at the hatch:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ships, master! Ships with oars!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“In what quarter?”</span> Hasdrubal sprang up, letting the dishes clatter. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“From Myconus. They come up fast. Hib at the masthead counts eleven triremes.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Baal preserve us!”</span> The master at once clambered on deck. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Greek fleet may be
              quitting Delos. We must pray for wind.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a gray, hazy day after a dozen bright ones. The northerly breeze seemed
            falling. The water spread out a sombre lead colour. The heights of Naxos were in sight
            to starboard, but none too clearly. Much more interesting to Hasdrubal was the line of
            dots spreading on the horizon to northwest. Despite the distance his keen eyes could
            catch the rise and fall of the oar banks—<a name="corr377" id="corr377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">war-ships</span>, 
            not traders. Hib was right, and
            Hasdrubal’s face grew longer. No triremes save the Greeks could be bearing thither, and
            a merchantman, even from nominally neutral Carthage, caught headed for the king’s coasts
            in those days of blazing war <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was nothing if not fair
            prize. The master’s decision was prompt. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They are far off. Put the ship before the wind.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sea-mouse was fleet indeed for a trader, but unlike a trireme must count on her
            canvas for her speed. With a piping breeze she could mock pursuit. In a calm she was
            fearfully handicapped. However, for a moment Hasdrubal congratulated himself he could
            slip away unnoticed. The distance was very great. Then his dark lips cursed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Moloch consume me! If I see aright, we are chased.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Two vessels, in fact, seemed turning away from the rest. They were heading straight
            after the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>. A long race it would be, but with the gale so
            light the chances were against the sea-mouse. Hasdrubal had no need to urge his crew to
            rig out the oars and tug furiously, if they wished to escape a Greek prison and a slave
            market. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The whole crew, forty black-visaged, black-eyed creatures, were soon busy over the
            dozen great sweeps in a frantic attempt to force the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> beyond
            danger. Panting, yelling, blaspheming, for a while they seemed holding their own, but
            the master watched with sinking heart the waning breeze. At the end of an hour their
            pursuers could be distinguished,—a tall trireme behind, but closer, pulling more
            rapidly, a penteconter, a slim scouting galley working fifty oars in a single bank. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hasdrubal began to shout desperately: <span class="tei tei-q">“Wind, Baal, wind! Fill the sails, and seven
              he-goats await thy altar in Carthage!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Either the god found the bribe too small or lacked the power to accept it. The breeze
            did not stiffen. The sailors strove like demons at the sweeps, but almost imperceptibly
            the gap betwixt them and the war-ships was narrowing.</p>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hiram, who had been rowing, now left his post to approach the master. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What of the captives? Crucifixion waits us all if they are found on the ship and tell
              their story. Kill them at once and fling the bodies overboard.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hasdrubal shook his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not yet. Still a good chance. I’ll not cast five hundred bright shekels to the fish
              till harder pressed. The breeze may strengthen.”</span> Then he redoubled his shout. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wind, Baal, wind!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But a little later the gap betwixt the sea-mouse and the penteconter had so dwindled
            that even the master’s inborn thrift began to yield to prudence. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hark you, Hib,”</span> he cried from the helm. <span class="tei tei-q">“Take Adherbal and Lars the Etruscan.
              It’s a good ten furlongs to that cursed galley still, but we must have those prisoners
              ready on deck. Over they go if the chase gets a bit closer.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The giant Libyan hastened to comply, while all the crew joined in the captain’s howl,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Wind, Baal, wind!”</span> and cried reckless vows, while they scanned the fateful
            stretch of gray-green water behind the stern, whereon liberty if not life depended. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The trireme, pulling only one of her banks, was dropping behind, her navarch leaving
            the tiring chase to the penteconter, but the latter hung on doggedly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Curse those war-ships with their long oars and heavy crews,”</span> growled Hib,
            reappearing above the hatch with the prisoners. <span class="tei tei-q">“The penteconter’s only nine furlongs
              off.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He had been obliged to release the captives from the stocks, but Hib had taken the
            precaution to place on the formidable athlete a pair of leg irons joined by a shackle.
            Not merely were Glaucon’s arms pinioned by a stout cord, but the great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Libyan was gripping them tightly. Lars and Adherbal conducted
            the other prisoners, whose feet, however, were not bound. For a moment the three
            captives stood blinking at the unfamiliar light, unconscious of the situation and their
            extremity, whilst Hasdrubal for the fortieth time measured the distance. The wind had
            strengthened a little. Let it strengthen a trifle more and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> would hold her own. Still her people were nearly spent with their toiling,
            and the keen beak and large complement of the man-of-war made resistance madness if she
            once came alongside. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Have ready sand-bags,”</span> ordered Hasdrubal, <span class="tei tei-q">“to tie to these wretches’ feet. Set
              them by the boat mast, so the sail can hide our pretty deed from the penteconter. Have
              ready an axe. We’ll bide a little longer, though, before we say <span class="tei tei-q">‘farewell’</span> to our
              passengers. The gods may help yet.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hib and his fellows were marching the prisoners to the poop, when the sight of the
            war-ship told Phormio all the story. No gag now hindered his tongue. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, dragons from Carthage, are you going to murder us?”</span> he began in tones more
            indignant than terrified. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“No, save as Heaven enjoins it!”</span> quoth the master, clapping his hands to urge on
            the rowing stroke. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray, then, your Æolus, Hellene, to stiffen the breeze.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray, then, to Pluto, whelps,”</span> bawled the undaunted fishmonger, <span class="tei tei-q">“to give you a
              snug berth in Orcus. Ha! but it’s a merry thought of you and all your pretty lads
              stretched on crosses and waiting for the crows.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But a violent screech came from Lampaxo, who had just comprehended the fate awaiting. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ai! ai!</span></span> save me, fellow-Hellenes!”</span> she bawled toward the
            penteconter, <span class="tei tei-q">“a citizeness of Athens, the most patriotic woman in the city,
              slaughtered by Barbarians—”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence the squealing sow!”</span> roared Hasdrubal. <span class="tei tei-q">“They’ll <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hear her on the war-ship. Aft with her and overboard at once.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But as they dragged Lampaxo on the poop, her outcry rose to a tempest till Lars the
            Etruscan clapped his hand upon her mouth. Her screaming stilled, but his own outcry more
            than replaced it. In a twinkling the virago’s hard teeth closed over his fingers. Two
            ran from the oars to him. But the woman, conscious that she fought for life or death,
            held fast. Curses, blows, even a dagger pried betwixt her lips—all bootless. She seemed
            as a thing possessed. And all the time the Etruscan howled in mortal agony. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The thin dagger, bent too hard, snapped betwixt her teeth. Lars’s clamour could surely
            be heard on the penteconter. Again the breeze was falling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They seized the fury’s throat, and pressed it till she turned black, but the grip of
            her jaw only tightened. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Attatai! attatai!</span></span>”</span> groaned the victim, <span class="tei tei-q">“forbear. Don’t
              throttle her. Her teeth are iron. They are biting through the bone. If you strangle
              her, they will never relax. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Attatai! attatai!</span></span>”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Nip him tight, little wife,”</span> called Phormio, for once regarding his spouse with
            supreme satisfaction. <span class="tei tei-q">“It’s a dainty morsel you have in your mouth. Chew it well!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lampaxo’s attackers paused an instant, uncertain how to release the Etruscan. To their
            threats of torture the woman was deaf as the mainmast, and still the Etruscan screamed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon had stood perfectly passive during all this grim by-play. Once Phormio saw his
            fellow-captive’s face twist into a smile, but in the excitement of the moment the
            fishmonger as well as the Carthaginians almost forgot the Isthmionices, and Hib relaxed
            his grip and guard. Lars’s finger was streaming red, when Hasdrubal threw away the
            steering-paddle in a rage. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span>
          <a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence her forever! The axe, Hib. Split her skull open!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The axe lay at the Libyan’s feet. One instant, only one, betook his hands from the
            athlete’s wrists to seize the weapon, but in that instant the yell from all the crew
            drowned even the howls of Lars. Had any watched, they might have seen all the muscles in
            the Alcmæonid’s glorious body contract, might have seen the fire spring from his eyes as
            he put forth a godlike might. Heracles and Athena Polias had been with him when he threw
            his strength upon the bands that held his arms. The crushing of Lycon down had been no
            feat like this. In a twinkling the cords about his wrists were snapped. He swung his
            free hands in the air. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Athens!”</span> he shouted, whilst the crew stood spellbound. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hermione! Glaucon is
              still Glaucon!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hib had grasped the axe, but he never knew what smote him once behind the ear and sent
            him rolling lifeless against the bulwark. In an instant his bright weapon was swinging
            high above the athlete’s head. Glaucon stood terrible as Achilles before the cowering
            Trojans. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe! woe! he is Melkarth. We are lost men!”</span> groaned the crew. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“At him, fools!”</span> bawled Hasdrubal, first to recover wits, <span class="tei tei-q">“his feet are still
              shackled.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But whilst the master called to them, the axe dashed down upon the fetters, and one
            great stroke smote the coupling-link in twain. The Athenian stood a moment looking right
            and left, the axe dancing as a toy in his grasp, and a smile on his face inviting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Prove me.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A javelin singing from the hand of Adherbal flew at him. An imperceptible bending of
            the body, a red streak on Glaucon’s naked side, and it dug into the deck. Yet whilst it
            quivered, was out again and hurled through the Cartha<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ginian’s breast and shoulders. He fell in a heap beside the Libyan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another howl from the sailors. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not Melkarth, but Baal the Dragon-Slayer. We are lost. Who can contend with him?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Cowards!”</span> thundered Hasdrubal, whipping the sword from his thigh, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you not
              know these three sniff our true business? If they live when the penteconter comes,
              it’s not prison but Sheol that’s waiting. Their lives or ours. One rush and we have
              this madman down!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But their terrible adversary gave the master no time to gather his myrmidons. One
            stroke of the axe had already released Phormio, who clutched the arms of his wife. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The cabin!”</span> the ready-witted fishmonger commanded, and Lampaxo, scarce knowing
            what she did, released her ungentle hold on Lars and suffered her husband to drag her
            down the ladder. Glaucon went last; no man loving death enough to come within reach of
            the axe. Hasdrubal saw his victims escaping under his eyes and groaned. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There is only one hatchway. We must force it. Darts, belaying-pins, ballast

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The penteconter is four furlongs away!”</span> shrieked a sailor, growing gray under his
            dark skin. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And Democrates’s despatches are hid in the cabin,”</span> added Hiram, chattering. <span class="tei tei-q">“If

              calamity and I vow thee even my daughter Tibaït,—a child in her tenth year,—she

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear, Baal! Hear, Moloch!”</span> chorussed the crew; and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gathering courage from necessity seized boat-hooks, oars, dirks, and all other handy
            weapons for their attack. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But below the released prisoners had not been idle. Never—Glaucon knew it—had his
            brain been clearer, his invention more fertile than now, and Phormio was not too old to
            cease to be a valiant helper. The cabin was small. A few spears and swords stood in the
            rack about the mast. The athlete bolted the sliding hatch-cover, and tore down the
            weapons. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Release your wife,”</span> he ordered Phormio; <span class="tei tei-q">“yonder sea chest is strong. Drag it

          </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ai, ai, ai!</span></span>”</span> screeched Lampaxo, who had released Lars’s
            fingers only to resume her din, <span class="tei tei-q">“we all perish. They are hewing the hatch-cover with
              their axes. Hera preserve us! The wood splinters. We die.”</span>
          </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“We have no time to die,”</span> called the athlete, <span class="tei tei-q">“but only to save Hellas.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A dozen blows beat the frail hatch-cover to splinters. A dark face with grinning teeth
            showed itself. A heavy ballast stone grazed the athlete’s shoulder, but the intruder
            fell back with a gurgling in his throat, his hands clutching the empty air. Glaucon had
            sent a heavy spear clean through him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More ballast stones, but the Titanic Alcmæonid had torn a mattress from a bunk, and
            held it as effective shield. By main force the others dragged the chest across to the
            hatchway, making the entrance doubly narrow. Vainly Hasdrubal stormed at his men to rush
            down boldly. They barely dared to fling stones and darts, so fast their adversary sped
            them back, and to the mark. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A god! a god! We fight against Heaven!”</span> bleated the seamen. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Their groans were answered by the screechings of Lampaxo through the port-hole and the
            taunts of Phormio. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sing, sing, pretty Pisinoë, sweetest of the sirens,”</span> tossed the fishmonger,
            playing his part at Glaucon’s side; <span class="tei tei-q">“lure that dear penteconter a little nearer. And
              you, brave, gentle sirs, don’t try <span class="tei tei-q">‘to flay a skinned dog’</span> by thrusting down
              here. Your hands are just itching for the nails, I warrant!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hasdrubal redoubled his vows to Moloch. In place of his daughter he substituted his
            son, though the lad was fourteen years old and the darling of his parents. But the god
            was not tempted even now. The attack on the cabin had called the sailors from the oars.
            The penteconter consequently had gained fast upon them. The trireme behind was manning
            her other banks and drawing down apace. Hiram cast a hopeless glance toward her. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I know those <span class="tei tei-q">‘eyes’</span>—those red hawse-holes—the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>.

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He approached the splintered hatchway and outstretched his hands—weaponless. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, good and gracious Master Glaucon, and your honest friends, your gods of Hellas
              are very great and have delivered us, your poor slaves, into your hands. Your friends

              the navarch to be merciful and generous.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Bah!”</span> spat Phormio, <span class="tei tei-q">“you write your promises in water, or better in oil,
              black-scaled viper. We know what time of day it is with us, and what for you.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hiram saw Glaucon’s hand rise with a javelin, and shrank shivering. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They won’t hearken. All’s lost,”</span> he whimpered, his smile becoming ghastly. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lead the charge yourself, master!”</span> retorted the seamen, sullenly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The captain, swinging a cutlass, leaped down the bloodstained hatch. One moment the
            desperate fury of his attack carried Glaucon backward. The two fought—sword against
            axe—in doubtful combat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow! follow!”</span> called Hasdrubal, dashing Phormio aside with the flat of his
            blade. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have him at last!”</span> But just as Hiram was leading down a dozen more, the
            athlete’s axe swept past the sword, and fell like a millstone on the master’s skull. He
            never screamed as he crashed upon the planks. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This was enough. The seamen were at the end of their valour. If they must die, they
            must die. What use resisting destiny? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Slowly, slowly the moments crept for the three in the cabin. Even Lampaxo grew still.
            They heard Hiram pleading frantically, vainly, for another attempt, and raving strange
            things about Democrates, Lycon, and the Persian. Then behind the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> sounded the rushing of foam around a ram, the bumping of fifty oars plying
            on the thole-pins. Into their sight shot the penteconter, the brass glistening on her
            prow, the white blades leaping in rhythm. Marines in armour stood on the forecastle. A
            few arrows pattered on the plankings of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>. Her abject
            crew obeyed the demand to surrender. Their helmsman pushed over the steering-paddle, and
            flung himself upon the deck. The sea-mouse went up into the wind. The grappling-irons
            rattled over the bulwark. Glaucon heard the Phœnicians whining, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mercy! mercy!”</span> as
            they embraced the boarders’ feet, then the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prōreus</span></span>, in hearty
            Attic, calling, <span class="tei tei-q">“Secure the prisoners and rummage the prize!”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon had suffered many things of late. He had faced intolerable captivity,
            immediate death. Now around his eyes swam hot mist. He fell upon a sea chest, and for a
            little cared not for anything around, whilst down his cheeks would flow the tears. </p>

            and ankle. Lampaxo had thrown her dress over her head and was screaming still, despite
            assurances. The third Hellene’s face was hid under a tangle of hair. But Cimon knew the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The seaman addressed passed a cord about the Phœnician’s forehead with a fearful

            beady eyes started from his head, but he did not speak. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Again,”</span> thundered the navarch, and as the cord stretched a howl of mortal agony
            escaped the prisoner. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The miserable creature fell to the deck, pressing his hands to his temples and moaning
            in agony. No one heeded him now. Cimon himself ran below to the mast, and wrenched the
            peg from its socket. Papyrus sheets were there, rolled compactly, covered with writing
            and sealed. The navarch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>turned over the packet
            curiously, then to the amazement of the sailors seemed to stagger against the mast. He
            was as pale as Hiram. He thrust the packet into the hands of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prōreus</span></span>, who stood near. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And why not Democrates?”</span> The words came from the released prisoner, who had been
            so silent, but who had glided down and stood at Cimon’s elbow. He spoke in a changed
            voice now; again the navarch was startled. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Is Themistocles on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>?”</span> asked the stranger,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—but your voice, your face, your manner—my head is dizzy.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The son of Miltiades was a strong man. He had looked on Hiram’s tortures with a laugh.
            To his own death he would have gone with no eyelash trembling. But now the rest saw him
            blench; then with a cry, at once of wonder and inexpressible joy, his arms closed round
            the tattered outlaw’s neck. Treason or no treason—what matter! He forgot all save that
            before him was his long-time comrade. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My friend! My boyhood’s friend!”</span> and so for many times they kissed. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> had followed the chase at easy distance, ready
            with aid in case the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> resisted. Themistocles was in his
            cabin with Simonides, when Cimon and Glaucon came to him. The admiral heard his young
            navarch’s report, then took the unopened packet and requested Cimon and the poet to
            withdraw. As their feet sounded on the ladder in the companionway, Themistocles turned
            on the outlaw, it seemed, fiercely. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell your story.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon told it: the encounter on the hillside at Trœzene, the seizure in Phormio’s
            house, the coming of Democrates and his boasts over the captives, the voyage and the
            pursuing. The son of Neocles never hastened the recital, though once or twice he widened
            it by an incisive question. At the end he demanded:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And does Phormio confirm all this?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“All. Question him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Humph! He’s a truthful man in everything save the price of fish. Now let us open the
              packet.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles was exceeding deliberate. He drew his dagger and pried the wrapper open
            without breaking the seals or tearing the papyrus. He turned the strips of paper
            carefully one by one, opened a casket, and drew thence a written sheet which he compared
            painfully with those before him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The same hand,”</span> his remark in undertone. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was so calm that a stranger would have thought him engaged with routine business.
            Many of the sheets he simply lifted, glanced at, laid down again. They did not seem to
            interest. So through half the roll, but the outlaw, watching patiently, at last saw he
            eyebrows of the son of Neocles pressing ever closer,—sign that the inscrutable brain
            was at its fateful work. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At last he uttered one word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cipher.”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span>
          <a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A sheet lay before him covered with broken words and phrases—seemingly without
            meaning—but the admiral knew the secret of the Spartan <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scytalē</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-q">“cipher wood.”</span> Forth from his casket came a number of rounded
            sticks of varying lengths. On one after another he wound the sheet spirally until at the
            fifth trial the scattered words came together. He read with ease. Then Themistocles’s
            brows grew closer than before. He muttered softly in his beard. But still he said
            nothing aloud. He read the cipher sheet through once, twice; it seemed thrice. Other
            sheets he fingered delicately, as though he feared the touch of venom. All without
            haste, but at the end, when Themistocles arose from his seat, the outlaw trembled. Many
            things he had seen, but never a face so changed. The admiral was neither flushed nor
            pale. But ten years seemed added to those lines above his eyes. His cheeks were
            hollowed. Was it fancy that put the gray into his beard and hair? Slowly he rose; slowly
            he ordered the marine on guard outside the cabin to summon Simonides, Cimon, and all the
            officers of the flag-ship. They trooped hither and filled the narrow cabin—fifteen or
            more hale, handsome Athenians, intent on the orders of the admiral. Were they to dash at
            once for Samos and surprise the Persian? Or what other adventure waited? The breeze had
            died. The gray breast of the Ægean rocked the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> softly.
            The thranites of the upper oar bank were alone on the benches, and stroking the great
            trireme along to a singsong chant about Amphitrite and the Tritons. On the poop above
            two sailors were grumbling lest the penteconter’s people get all the booty of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>. Glaucon heard their grunts and complainings whilst he looked
            on Themistocles’s awful face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The officers ranged themselves and saluted stiffly. Themistocles stood before them,
            his hands closed over the packet. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The first time he
            started to speak his lips closed desperately. The silence grew awkward. Then the admiral
            gave his head a toss, and drew his form together as a runner before a race. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Democrates is a traitor. Unless Athena shows us mercy, Hellas is lost.”</span>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The cry from the startled men rang through the ship. The rowers ceased their chant and
            their stroking. Themistocles beckoned angrily for silence. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not call you down to wail and groan.”</span> He never raised his voice; his
            calmness made him terrible. But now the questions broke loose as a flood. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“When? How? Declare.”</span>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet despite him men wept on one another’s shoulders as became true Hellenes, whilst
            Themistocles, whose inexorable face never relaxed, rewound the papyrus on the cipher

              fatherland. Pausanias and Aristeides must be warned. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> is the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Salaminia,’</span>—the swiftest trireme in the fleet. Ours must
              be the deed, and ours the glory. Enough of this—the men must hear, and then to the
              oars.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles had changed from despair to a triumph note. There was uplift even to look
            upon him. He strode before all his <a name="corr396" id="corr396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">lieutenants</span> up and out
            upon the poop. The long tiers of benches and the gangways filled with rowers peered up
            at him. They had seen their officers gather in the cabin, and Dame Rumour, subtlest of
            Zeus’s messengers, had breathed <span class="tei tei-q">“ill-tidings.”</span> Now the admiral stood forth, and in
            few words told all the heavy tale. Again a great shout, whilst the bronzed men groaned
            on the benches. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Democrates is a traitor!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A deity had fallen from their Olympus; the darling of the Athenians’s democracy was
            sunk to vilest of the vile. But the admiral knew how to play on their two hundred hearts
            better than Orpheus upon his lyre. Again the note changed from despair to incitement,
            and when at last he called, <span class="tei tei-q">“And can we cross the Ægean as never trireme crossed and
              pluck back Hellas from her fate?”</span> thalamite, zygite, and thranite rose, tossing
            their brawny arms into the air. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We can!</span></span>”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then Themistocles folded his own arms and smiled. He felt the god was still with him. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet, eager as was the will, they could not race forth instantly. Orders must be
            written to Xanthippus, the Athenian vice-admiral far away, bidding him at all hazards to
            keep the Persian fleet near Samos. Cimon was long in privy council with Themistocles in
            the state cabin. At the same time a prisoner was passed aboard the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>, not gently bound,—Hiram, a precious witness, before the dogs had
            their final meal on him. But the rest of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra’s</span></span> people found
            a quicker release. The penteconter’s people decided their fate with a yell. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sell such harpies for slaves? The money would stink through our pouches!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So two by two, tied neck to neck and heel to heel, the wretches were flung overboard,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“because we lack place and wood to crucify you,”</span> called the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> governor, as he pushed the last pair off into the leaden sea,—for
            the day was distant when the destruction of such Barbarian rogues would weigh even on
            tender consciences. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So the Carthaginians ceased from troubling, but before the penteconter and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> bore away to join the remaining fleet, another deed was done
            in sight of all three ships. For whilst Themistocles was with Cimon, Simonides and
            Sicinnus had taken Glaucon to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> forecastle. Now as
            the penteconter was casting off, again he came to view, and the shout that greeted him
            was not of fear this time, but wonder and delight. The Alcmæonid was clean-shaven, his
            hair clipped close, the black dye even in a manner washed away. He had flung off the
            rough seaman’s dress, and stood forth in all his godlike beauty. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before all men Cimon, coming from the cabin, ran and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kissed him once more, whilst the rowers clapped their hands. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Apollo—it is Delian Apollo! Glaucon the Beautiful lives again. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Io!

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> spoke Themistocles, in a burst of gladness. <span class="tei tei-q">“The gods take one friend,
              they restore another. Œdipus has read the sphinx’s riddle. Honour this man, for he is
              worthy of honour through Hellas!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The officers ran to the athlete, after them the sailors. They covered his face and
            hands with kisses. He seemed escaped the Carthaginian to perish in the embrace of his
            countrymen. Never was his blush more boyish, more divine. Then a bugle-blast sent every
            man to his station. Cimon leaped across to his smaller ship. The rowers of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> ran out their oars, the hundred and seventy blades trailed
            in the water. Every man took a long breath and fixed his eyes on the admiral standing on
            the poop. He held a golden goblet set with turquoise, and filled with the blood-red
            Pramnian wine. Loudly Themistocles prayed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus of Olympus and Dodona, Zeus Orchios, rewarder of the oath-breaker, to whom the
              Hellenes do not vainly pray, and thou Athena of the Pure Eyes, give ear. Make our ship
              swift, our arms strong, our hearts bold. Hold back the battle that we come not too
              late. Grant that we confound the guilty, put to flight the Barbarian, recompense the
              traitor. So to you and all other holy gods whose love is for the righteous we will
              proffer prayer and sacrifice forever. Amen.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He poured out the crimson liquor; far into the sea he flung the golden cup. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven speed you!”</span> shouted from the penteconter. Themistocles nodded. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes</span></span> smote his gavel upon the sounding-board. The triple oar
            bank rose as one and plunged into the foam. A long <span class="tei tei-q">“h-a!”</span> went up from the benches.
            The race to save Hellas was begun. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chase had cost the Athenians dear. Before the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> had
            submitted to her fate, she had led the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> and her consort
            well down into the southern Ægean. A little more and they would have lifted the shaggy
            headlands of Crete. The route before the great trireme was a long one. Two thousand
              stadia,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> as the crow flies, sundered
            them from the Euripus, the nearest point whence they could despatch a runner to
            Pausanias and Aristeides; and what with the twistings around the scattered Cyclades the
            route was one-fourth longer. But men had ceased reckoning distance. Their hearts were in
            the flying oars, and at first the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> ran leaping across the
            waves as leaps the dolphin,—the long gleaming blades springing like shuttles in the
            hands of the ready crew. They had taken from the penteconter all her spare rowers, and
            to make the great ship bound over the steel-gray deep was children’s play. <span class="tei tei-q">“We must
              save Hellas, and we can!”</span> That was the thought of all from Themistocles to the
            meanest thranite. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So at the beginning when the task seemed light and hands were strong. The breeze that
            had betrayed the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span> ever sank lower. Presently it died
            altogether. The sails they set hung limp on the mast. The navarch had them furled. The
            sea spread out before them, a glassy, leaden-coloured floor; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the waves roaring in their wake faded in a wide ripple far behind. To

            sounding-board, and clapped lips to his pipe. The whole trireme chorussed the familiar

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Bravely thus for a while, but at last Themistocles, watching from the poop with eyes
            that nothing evaded, saw how here and there the dip of the blades was weakening, here
            and there a breast was heaving rapidly, a mouth was panting for air. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The relief,”</span> he ordered. And the spare rowers ran gladly to the places of those
            who seemed the weariest. Only a partial respite. Fifty supernumeraries were a poor
            stop-gap for the one hundred and seventy. Only the weakest could be relieved, and even
            those wept and pled to continue at the benches a little longer. The thunderous threat of
            Ameinias, that he who refused a proffered relief must stand all day by the mast with an
            iron anchor on his shoulder, alone sufficed to make the malcontents give place. Yet
            after a little while the singing died. Breath was too precious to waste. It was mockery
            to troll of <span class="tei tei-q">“Æolus’s winds”</span> whilst the sea was one motionless mirror of gray. The
            monotonous <span class="tei tei-q">“beat,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“beat”</span> of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes’s</span></span> hammer, and the creaking of the
            oars in their leathered holes alone broke the stillness that reigned through the length
            of the trireme. The penteconter and her prize had long since faded below the horizon.
            With almost wistful eyes men watched the islets as they glided past one after another,
            Thera now, then Ios, and presently the greater Paros and Naxos lay before them. They
            relieved oars whenever possible. The supernumeraries needed no urging after their scanty
            rest to spring to the place of him who was fainting, but hardly any man spoke a word. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They were betwixt Paros and Naxos at last. Wine and barley cakes soaked in oil were
            passed among the men at the oars. They ate without leaving the benches. And still the
            sea spread out glassy, motionless, and the pennon hung limp on the mainmast. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes</span></span> slowed his beatings, but the men did not obey him. No
            whipped cattle were they, such as rowed the triremes of Phœnicia, but freemen born, sons
            of Athens, who called it joy to die for her in time of need. Therefore despite the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes’s</span></span> beats, despite Themistocles’s command, the rowing might
            not slacken. And the black wave around the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> bow sang
            its monotonous music. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Themistocles ever turned his face eastward, until men thought he was awaiting some
            foe in chase, and presently—just as a rower among the zygites fell back with the blood
            gushing from mouth and nostrils—the admiral pointed his finger toward the sky-line of
            the morning. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Look! Athena is with us!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And for the first time in hours those panting, straining men let the hot oar butts
            slip from their hands, even trail <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the darkling
            water, whilst they rose, looked, and blessed their gods. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was coming, the strong kind Eurus out of the south and east. They could see the
            black ripple springing over the glassy sea; they could hear the singing of the cordage;
            they could catch the sweet sniff of the brine. Admiral and rower lifted their hands
            together at this manifest favour of heaven. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Poseidon is with us! Athena is with us! Æolus is with us! We can save Hellas!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Soon the sun burst forth above the mist. All the wide ocean floor was adance with
            sparkling wavelets. No need of Ameinias’s lusty call to bend again the sails. The
            smaller canvas on the foremast and great spread on the mainmast were bellying to the
            piping gale. A fair wind, but no storm. The oars were but helpers now,—men laughed,
            hugged one another as boys, wept as girls, and let the benignant wind gods labour for
            them. Delos the Holy they passed, and Tenos, and soon the heights of Andros lifted, as
            the ship with its lading of fate flew over the island-strewn sea. At last, just as the
            day was leaving them, they saw Helios going down into the fire-tinged waves in a parting
            burst of glory. Darkness next, but the kindly wind failed not. Through the night no man
            on that trireme slumbered. Breeze or calm, he who had an obol’s weight of power spent it
            at the oars. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Long after midnight Themistocles and Glaucon clambered the giddy cordage to the ship’s
            top above the swelling mainsail. On the narrow platform, with the stars above, the dim
            tracery of the wide sail, the still dimmer tracery of the long ship below, they seemed
            transported to another world. Far beneath by the glimmer of the lanterns they saw the
            rowers swaying at their toil. In the wake the phosphorous bubbles ran away, opalescent
            gleams springing upward, as if torches of Doris and her dancing Nereids. So much had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>admiral and outlaw lived through this day they had
            thought little of themselves. Now calmer thought returned. Glaucon could tell of many
            things he had heard and thought, of the conversation overheard the morning before
            Salamis, of what Phormio had related during the weary captivity in the hold of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>. Themistocles pondered long. Yet for Glaucon when standing
            even on that calm pinnacle the trireme must creep over the deep too slowly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O give me wings, Father Zeus,”</span> was his prayer; <span class="tei tei-q">“yes, the wings of Icarus. Let me
              fly but once to confound the traitor and deliver thy Hellas,—after that, like Icarus
              let me fall. I am content to die.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Themistocles pressed close against his side. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ask for no wings,”</span>—in the
            admiral’s voice was a tremor not there when he sped confidence through the crew,—<span class="tei tei-q">“if
              it be destined we save Hellas, it is destined; if we are to die, we die. <span class="tei tei-q">‘No man of

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The admiral’s hold upon the younger Athenian’s arm tightened. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I will prove that Aristeides is not the only man in Hellas who deserves the name of
                <span class="tei tei-q">‘Just.’</span> When I was young, my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tutor would

              will against all the power of Persia. Zeus willing, I shall conquer. But the Olympians
              demand their price. For saving Hellas I must pay—Democrates. I loved him.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The two men stood in silence long, whilst below the oars and the rushing water played
            their music. At last the admiral relaxed his hand on Glaucon. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eu!</span></span> They will call me <span class="tei tei-q">‘Saviour of Hellas’</span> if all goes
              well. I shall be greater than Solon, or Lycurgus, or Periander, and in return I must
              do justice to a friend. Fair recompense!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The laugh of the son of Neocles was harsher than a cry. The other answered nothing.
            Themistocles set his foot on the ladder. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I must return to the men. I would go to an oar, only they will not let me.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The admiral left Glaucon for a moment alone. All around him was the night,—the stars,
            the black æther, the blacker sea,—but he was not lonely. He felt as when in the
            foot-race he turned for the last burst toward the goal. One more struggle, one supreme
            summons of strength and will, and after that the triumph and the rest.—Hellas, Athens,
            Hermione, he was speeding back to all. Once again all the things past floated out of the
            dream-world and before him,—the wreck, the lotus-eating at Sardis, Thermopylæ, Salamis,
            the agony on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>. Now came the end, the end promised in
            the moment of vision whilst he pulled the boat at Salamis. What was it? He tried not to
            ask. Enough it was to be the end. He, like Themistocles, had supreme con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fidence that the treason would be thwarted. The gods were cruel,
            but not so cruel that after so many deliverances they would crush him at the last. <span class="tei tei-q">“The miracles of Zeus are never wrought in vain.”</span> Had not Zeus wrought miracles for
            him once and twice? The proverb was great comfort. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Suddenly whilst he built his palace of phantasy, a cry from the foreship dissolved it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Attica, Attica, hail, all hail!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He saw upon the sky-line the dim tracery of the Athenian headlands <span class="tei tei-q">“like a shield
              laid on the misty deep.”</span> Again men were springing from the oars, laughing, weeping,
            embracing, whilst under the clear, unflagging wind the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span>
            sped up the narrowing strait betwixt Eubœa and the mainland. Dawn glowed at last,
            unveiling the brown Attic shoreline with Pentelicus the marble-fretted and all his
            darker peers. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hour by hour they ran onward. They skirted the long low coast of Eubœa to the
            starboard. They saw Marathon and its plain of fair memories stretching to port, and now
            the strait grew closer yet, and it needed all the governor’s skill at the steering-oars
            to keep the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> from the threatening rocks. Marathon was
            behind at last. The trireme rounded the last promontory; the bay grew wider; the prow
            was set more to westward. Every man—the faintest—struggled back to his oar if he had
            left it—this was the last hundred stadia to Oropus, and after that the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä</span></span> might do no more. Once again the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">keleustes</span></span> piped, and his note was swift and feverish. The blades shot faster,
            faster, as the trireme raced down the sandy shore of the Attic <span class="tei tei-q">“Diacria.”</span> Once in
            the strait they saw a brown-sailed fisherboat, and the helm swerved enough to bring her
            within hail. The fishermen stared at the flying trireme and her straining, wide-eyed
            men. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span>
          <a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Has there been a battle?”</span> cried Ameinias. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not yet. We are from Styra on Eubœa; we expect the news daily. The armies are almost
              together.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And where are they?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Near to Platæa.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That was all. The war-ship left the fishermen rocking in her wake, but again
            Themistocles drew his eyebrows close together, while Glaucon tightened the buckle on his
            belt. Platæa,—the name meant that the courier must traverse the breadth of Bœotia, and
            with the armies face to face how long would Zeus hold back the battle? How long indeed,
            with Democrates and Lycon intent on bringing battle to pass? The ship was more than ever
            silent as she rushed on the last stretch of her course. More men fell at the oars with
            blood upon their faces. The supernumeraries tossed them aside like logs of wood, and
            leaped upon their benches. Themistocles had vanished with Simonides in the cabin; all
            knew their work,—preparing letters to Aristeides and Pausanias to warn of the bitter
            truth. Then the haven at last: the white-stuccoed houses of Oropus clustering down upon
            the shore, the little mole, a few doltish peasants by the landing gaping at the great
            trireme. No others greeted them, for the terror of Mardonius’s Tartar raiders had driven
            all but the poorest to some safe shelter. The oars slipped from numb fingers; the anchor
            plunged into the green water; the mainsail rattled down the mast. Men sat on the benches
            motionless, gulping down the clear air. They had done their part. The rest lay in the
            hands of the gods, and in the speed of him who two days since they had called <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon
              the Traitor.”</span> The messenger came from the cabin, half stripped, on his head a felt
            skullcap, on his feet high hunter’s boots laced up to the knees. He had never shone in
            more noble beauty. The crew watched Themistocles place a papyrus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>roll in Glaucon’s belt, and press his mouth to the messenger’s ear in
            parting admonition. Glaucon gave his right hand to Themistocles, his left to Simonides.
            Fifty men were ready to man the pinnace to take him ashore. On the beach the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> people saw him stand an instant, as he turned his face
            upward to the <span class="tei tei-q">“dawn-facing”</span> gods of Hellas, praying for strength and swiftness. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Apollo speed you!”</span> called two hundred after him. He answered from the beach with a
            wave of his beautiful arms. A moment later he was hid behind a clump of olives. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nausicaä’s</span></span> people knew the ordeal before him, but many a man said
            Glaucon had the easier task. He could run till life failed him. They now could only fold
            their hands and wait. </p>
          
            <div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * * * </div>
          
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was long past noon when Glaucon left the desolate village of Oropus behind him. The
            day was hot, but after the manner of Greece not sultry, and the brisk breeze was
            stirring on the hill slopes. Over the distant mountains hung a tint of deep violet. It
            was early in Bœdromion.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> The
            fields—where indeed the Barbarian cavalry men had not deliberately burned them—were
            seared brown by the long dry summer. Here and there great black crows were picking, and
            a red fox would whisk out of a thicket and go with long bounds across the unharvested
            fields to some safer refuge. Glaucon knew his route. Three hundred and sixty stadia lay
            before him, and those not over the well-beaten course in the gymnasium, but by rocky
            goat trails and by-paths that made his task no easier. He started off slowly. He was too
            good an athlete to waste his speed by one fierce burst at the outset. At first his road
            was no bad one, for he skirted the willow-hung Asopus, the boundary stream be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>twixt Attica and Bœotia. But he feared to keep too long upon
            this highway to Tanagra, and of the dangers of the road he soon met grim warnings. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> First, it was a farmstead in black ruin, with the carcass of a horse half burned lying
            before the gate. Next, it was the body of a woman, three days slain, and in the centre
            of the road,—no pleasant sight, for the crows had been at their banquet,—and hardened
            though the Alcmæonid was to war, he stopped long enough to cast the ceremonial handful
            of dust on the poor remains, as symbolic burial, and sped a wish to King Pluto to give
            peace to the wanderer’s spirit. Next, people met him: an old man, his wife, his young
            son,—wretched shepherd-folk dressed in sheepskins,—the boy helping his elders as they
            tottered along on their staves toward the mountain. At sight of Glaucon they feebly made
            to fly, but he held out his hand, showing he was unarmed, and they halted also. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Whence and whither, good father?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Whereat the old man began to shake all over and tell a mumbling story, how they had
            been set upon by the Scythian troopers in their little farm near Œnophytæ, how he had
            seen the farmhouse burn, his two daughters swung shrieking upon the steeds of the wild
            Barbarians, and as for himself and his wife and son, Athena knew what saved them! They
            had lost all but life, and fearful for that were seeking a cave on Mt. Parnes. Would not
            the young man come with them, a thousand dangers lurked upon the way? But Glaucon did
            not wait to hear the story out. On he sped up the rocky road. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, Mardonius! ah, Artazostra!”</span> he was speaking in his heart, <span class="tei tei-q">“noble and brave
              you are to your peers, but this is your rare handiwork,—and though you once called me
              friend, Zeus and Dikē still rule, there is a price for this and you shall tell it
              out.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet he bethought himself of the old man’s warning, and left the beaten way. At the
            long steady trot learned in the stadium, he went onward under the greenwood behind the
            gleaming river, where the vines and branches whipped on his face; and now and again he
            crossed a half-dried brook, where he swept up a little water in his hands, and said a
            quick prayer to the friendly nymphs of the stream. Once or twice he sped through fig
            orchards, and snatched at the ripe fruit as he ran, eating without slackening his
            course. Presently the river began to bend away to westward. He knew if he followed it,
            he came soon to Tanagra, but whether that town were held by the Persians or burned by
            them, who could tell? He quitted the Asopus and its friendly foliage. The bare wide
            plain of Bœotia was opening. Concealment was impossible, unless indeed he turned far
            eastward toward Attica and took refuge on the foothills of the mountains. But speed was
            more precious than safety. He passed Scolus, and found the village desolate, burned. No
            human being greeted him, only one or two starving dogs rushed forth to snap, bristle,
            and be chased away by a well-sent stone. Here and yonder in the fields were still the
            clusters of crows picking at carrion,—more tokens that Mardonius’s Tartar raiders had
            done their work too well. Then at last, an hour or more before the sunset, just as the
            spurs of Cithæron, the long mountain over against Attica, began to thrust their bald
            summits up before the runner’s ken, far ahead upon the way approached a cloud of dust.
            The Athenian paused in his run, dashed into the barren field, and flung himself flat
            between the furrows. He heard the hoof-beats of the wiry steppe horses, the clatter of
            targets and scabbards, the shrill shouts of the raiders. He lifted his head enough to
            see the red streamers on their lance tips flutter past. He let the noise die away before
            he dared to take the road once more. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The time he lost
            was redeemed by a burst of speed. His head was growing very hot, but it was not time to
            think of that. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Already the hills were spreading their shadows, and Platæa was many stadia away.
            Knowledge of how much remained made him reckless. He ran on without his former caution.
            The plain was again changing to undulating foothills. He had passed Erythræ
            now,—another village burned and deserted. He mounted a slope, was descending to mount
            another, when lo! over the hill before came eight riders at full speed. What must be
            done, must be done quickly. To plunge into the fallow field again were madness, the
            horsemen had surely seen him, and their sure-footed beasts could run over the furrows
            like rabbits. Glaucon stood stock still and stretched forth both hands, to show the
            horsemen he did not resist them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O Athena Polias,”</span> uprose the prayer from his heart, <span class="tei tei-q">“if thou lovest not me,
              forget not thy love for Hellas, for Athens, for Hermione my wife.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The riders were on him instantly, their crooked swords flew out. They surrounded their
            captive, uttering outlandish cries and chatterings, ogling, muttering, pointing with
            their swords and lances as if debating among themselves whether to let the stranger go
            or hew him in pieces. Glaucon stood motionless, looking from one to another and asking
            for wisdom in his soul. Seven were Tartars, low-browed, yellow-skinned, flat of nose,
            with the grins of apes. He might expect the worst from these. But the eighth showed a
            long blond beard under his leather helm, and Glaucon rejoiced; the chief of the band was
            a Persian and more amenable. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Tartars continued gesturing and debating, flourishing their steel points right at
            the prisoner’s breast. He regarded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them calmly, so
            calmly that the Persian gave vent to his admiration. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Down with your lance-head, Rūkhs. By Mithra, I think this Hellene is brave as he
              is beautiful! See how he stands. We must have him to the Prince.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Excellency,”</span> spoke Glaucon, in his best court Persian, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a courier to the
              Lord Mardonius. If you are faithful servants of his Eternity the king, where is your
              camp?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chief started. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“On the life of my father, you speak Persian as if you dwelled in Eran at the king’s
              own doors! What do you here alone upon this road in Hellas?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Glaucon put out his hand before answering, caught the tip of Rūkhs’s lance, and
            snapped it short like a reed. He knew the way to win the admiration of the Barbarians.
            They yelled with delight, all at least save Rūkhs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Strong as he is brave and handsome,”</span> cried the Persian. <span class="tei tei-q">“Again—who are you?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Alcmæonid drew himself to full height and gave his head its lordliest poise. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Understand, Persian, that I have indeed lived long at the king’s gates. Yes,—I have
              learned my Aryan at the Lord Mardonius’s own table, for I am the son of Attaginus of
              Thebes, who is not the least of the friends of his Eternity in Hellas.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The mention of one of the foremost Medizers of Greece made the subaltern bend in his
            saddle. His tone became even obsequious. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, I understand. Your Excellency is a courier. You have despatches from the
            king?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Despatches of moment just landed from Asia. Now tell me where the army is

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“By the Asopus, much to northward. The Hellenes lie to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>south. Here, Rūkhs, take the noble courier behind you on the horse, and conduct
              him to the general.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven bless your generosity,”</span> cried the runner, with almost precipitate haste, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I know the country well, and the worthy Rūkhs will not thank me if I deprive
              him of his share in your booty.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, yes, we have heard of a farm across the hills at Eleutheræ that’s not yet been
              plundered,—handsome wenches, and we’ll make the father dig up his pot of money. Mazda

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yeh! yeh!”</span> yelled the seven Tartars, none more loudly than Rūkhs, who had no
            hankering for conducting a courier back into the camp. So the riders came and went,
            whilst Glaucon drew his girdle one notch tighter and ran onward through the gathering
            evening. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The adventure had been a warning. Once Athena had saved him, not perchance
            twice,—again he took to the fields. He did not love the sight of the sun ever lower, on
            the long brown ridge of Helicon far to west. Until now he scarce thought enough of self
            to realize the terrible draughts he had made upon his treasure-house of strength. Could
            it be that he—the Isthmionices, who had crushed down the giant of Sparta before the
            cheering myriads—could faint like a weary girl, when the weal of Hellas was his to win
            or lose? Why did his tongue burn in his throat as a coal? Why did those feet—so swift,
            so ready when he sped from Oropus—lift so heavily? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As a flash it came over him what he had endured,—the slow agony on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bozra</span></span>, the bursting of the bands, the fight for life, the scene
            with Themistocles, the sleepless night on the trireme. Now he was running as the wild
            hare runs before the baying chase. Could it be that all this race was vain? </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span>
          <a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“For Hellas! For Hermione!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Whilst he groaned through his gritted teeth, some malignant god made him misstep,
            stumble. He fell between the hard furrows, bruising his face and hands. After a moment
            he rose, but rose to sink back again with keen pain shooting through an ankle. He had
            turned it. For an instant he sat motionless, taking breath, then his teeth came together
            harder. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Themistocles trusts me. I carry the fate of Hellas. I can die, but I cannot fail.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was quite dusk now. The brief southern twilight was ending in pale bars of gold
            above Helicon. Glaucon rose again; the cold sweat sprang out upon his forehead. Before
            his eyes rose darkness, but he did not faint. Some kind destiny set a stout pole upright
            in the field,—perhaps for vines to clamber,—he clutched it, and stood until his sight
            cleared and the pain a little abated. He tore the pole from the ground, and reached the
            roadway. He must take his chance of meeting more raiders. He had one vast comfort,—if
            there had been no battle fought that day, there would be none before dawn. But he had
            still weary stadia before him, and running was out of the question. Ever and anon he
            would stop his hobbling, take air, and stare at the vague tracery of the
            hills,—Cithæron to southward, Helicon to west, and northward the wide dark Theban
            plain. He gave up counting how many times he halted, how many times he spoke the magic
            words, <span class="tei tei-q">“For Hellas! For Hermione!”</span> and forced onward his way. The moon failed, even
            the stars were clouded. A kind of brute instinct guided him. At last—he guessed it was
            nearly midnight—he caught once more the flashings of a shallow river and the dim
            outlines of shrubbery beside the bank—again the Asopus. He must take care or he would
            wander straight into Mardonius’s camp. Therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he
            stopped awhile, drank the cool water, and let the stream purl around his burning foot.
            Then he set his face to the south, for there lay Platæa. There he would find the
            Hellenes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was almost unconscious of everything save the fierce pain and the need to go
            forward even to the end. At moments he thought he saw the mountains springing out of
            their gloom,—Helicon and Cithæron beckoning him on, as with living fingers. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Not too late. Marathon was not vain, nor Thermopylæ, nor Salamis. You can save
              Hellas.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Who spoke that? He stared into the solitary night. Was he not alone? Then phantasms
            came as on a flood. He was in a kind of euthanasy. The pain of his foot had ceased. He
            saw the Paradise by Sardis and its bending feathery palms; he heard the tinkling of the
            Lydian harps, and Roxana singing of the magic Oxus, and the rose valleys of Eran. Next
            Roxana became Hermione. He was standing at her side on the knoll of Colonus, and
            watching the sun sink behind Daphni making the Acropolis glow with red fire and gold.
            Yet all the time he knew he was going onward. He must not stop. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For Hellas! For Hermione!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At last even the vision of the Violet-Crowned City faded to mist. Had he reached the
            end,—the rest by the fields of Rhadamanthus, away from human strife? The night was ever
            darkening. He saw nothing, felt nothing, thought nothing save that he was still going
            onward, onward. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At some time betwixt midnight and dawning an Athenian outpost was pacing his beat
            outside the lines of Aristeides. The allied Hellenes were retiring from their position
            by the Asopus to a more convenient spot by Platæa, less exposed to the dreaded Persian
            cavalry, but on the night march the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>contingents had
            become disordered. The Athenians were halting under arms,—awaiting orders from
            Pausanias the commander-in-chief. The outpost—Hippon, a worthy charcoal-burner of
            Archarnæ—was creeping gingerly behind the willow hedges, having a well-grounded fear of
            Tartar arrows. Presently his fox-keen ears caught footfalls from the road. His shield
            went up. He couched his spear. His eyes, sharpened by the long darkness, saw a man
            hardly running, nor walking, yet dragging one foot and leaning on a staff. Here was no
            Tartar, and Hippon sprang out boldly. </p>

            into Hippon’s hands. The latter, sorely puzzled, whistled through his fingers. A moment
            more the locharch of the scouting division and three comrades appeared. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

            fell forward heavily, groaned once, and lay on the roadway silent as the dead. The
            locharch drew forth the horn lantern he had masked under his chalmys and leaned over the
            stranger. The light fell on the seal of the packet gripped in the rigid fingers. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Never since Salamis had Persian hopes been higher than that night. What if the
            Spartans were in the field at last, and the incessant skirmishing had been partly to
            Pausanias’s advantage? Secure in his fortified camp by the Asopus, Mardonius could
            confidently wait the turn of the tide. His light Tartar cavalry had cut to pieces the
            convoys bringing provisions to the Hellenes. Rumour told that Pausanias’s army was ill
            fed, and his captains were at loggerheads. Time was fighting for Mardonius. A joyful
            letter he had sent to Sardis the preceding morning: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the king have patience. In
              forty days I shall be banqueting even in Sparta.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the evening the Prince sat at council with his commanders. Xerxes had left behind
            his own war pavilion, and here the Persians met. Mardonius sat on the high seat of the
            dais. Gold, purple, a hundred torches, made the scene worthy of the monarch himself.
            Beside the general stood a young page,—beautiful as Armaiti, fairest of the archangels.
            All looked on the page, but discreetly kept their thoughts to whispers, though many had
            guessed the secret of Mardonius’s companion. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The debate was long and vehement. Especially Artabazus, general of the rear-guard, was
            loud in asserting no battle should be risked. He was a crafty man, who, the Prince <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>suspected, was his personal enemy, but his opinion was
            worth respecting. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I repeat what I said before. The Hellenes showed how they could fight at Thermopylæ.
              Let us retire to Thebes.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Bravely said, valiant general,”</span> sneered Mardonius, none too civilly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is mine to speak, yours to follow my opinion as you list. I say we can conquer
              these Hellenes with folded hands. Retreat to Thebes; money is plentiful with us; we
              can melt our gold cups into coin. Sprinkle bribes among the hostile chiefs. We know
              their weakness. Not steel but gold will unlock the way to Sparta.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The generalissimo stood up proudly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Bribes and stealth? Did Cyrus and Darius win us empire with these? No, by the
              Fiend-Smiter, it was sharp steel and the song of the 
              <a name="corr419" id="corr419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">bow-string</span> that made Eran to
              prosper, and prosper to this day. But lest Artabazus think that in putting on the lion
              I have forgotten the fox, let the strangers now come to us stand forth, that he and
              every other may know how I have done all things for the glory of my master and the
              Persian name.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He smote with his commander’s mace upon the bronze ewer on the table. Instantly there
            appeared two soldiers, between them two men, one of slight, one of gigantic, stature,
            but both in Grecian dress. Artabazus sprang to his feet. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are these men—Thebans?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“From greater cities than Thebes. You see two new servants of the king, therefore
              friends of us all. Behold Lycon of Sparta and Democrates, friend of Themistocles.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His speech was Persian, but the newcomers both understood when he named them. The tall
            Laconian straightened his bull neck, as in defiance. The Athenian flushed. His head
            seemed sinking betwixt his shoulders. Much worm<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wood had
            he drunk of late, but none bitterer than this,—to be welcomed at the councils of the
            Barbarian. Artabazus salaamed to his superior half mockingly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily, son of Gobryas, I was wrong. You are guileful as a Greek. There can be no
              higher praise.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince’s nostrils twitched. Perhaps he was not saying all he felt. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your praise await the issue,”</span> he rejoined coldly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Suffice it that these
              friends were long convinced of the wisdom of aiding his Eternity, and to-night come
              from the camp of the Hellenes to tell all that has passed and why we should make ready
              for battle at the dawning.”</span> He turned to the Greeks, ordering in their own tongue,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Speak forth, I am interpreter for the council.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> An awkward instant followed. Lycon looked on Democrates. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“You are an Athenian, your tongue is readiest,”</span> he whispered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And you the first to Medize. Finish your handiwork,”</span> the retort. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We are waiting,”</span> prompted Mardonius, and Lycon held up his great head and began in
            short sentences which the general deftly turned into Persian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your cavalry has made our position by the Asopus intolerable. All the springs are
              exposed. We have to fight every time we try to draw water. To-day was a meeting of the
              commanders, many opinions, much wrangling, but all said we must retire. The town of
              Platæa is best. It is strong, with plenty of water. You cannot attack it. To-night our
              camp has been struck. The troops begin to retire, but in disorder. The contingent of
              each city marches by itself. The Athenians, thanks to Democrates, delay retreating;
              the Spartans I have delayed also. I have per<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>suaded
              Amompharetus, my cousin, who leads the Pitanate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mora</span></span>,<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> and who was not at the council,
              that it is cowardly for a Spartan to retreat. He is a sheep-skulled fool and has
              believed me. Consequently, he and his men are holding back. The other Spartans wait
              for them. At dawn you will find the Athenians and Spartans alone near their old
              camping ground, their allies straggling in the rear. Attack boldly. When the onset
              joins, Democrates and I will order our own divisions to retire. The phalanxes will be
              broken up. With your cavalry you will have them at mercy, for once the spear-hedge is
              shattered, they are lost. The battle will not cost you twenty men.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Artabazus rose again and showed his teeth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A faithful servant of the king, Mardonius,—and so well is all provided, do we brave
              Aryans need even to string our bows?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince winced at the sarcasm. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am serving the king, not my own pleasure,”</span> he retorted stiffly. <span class="tei tei-q">“The son of
              Gobryas is too well known to have slurs cast on his courage. And now what questions
              would my captains ask these Greeks? Promptly—they must be again in their own lines,
              or they are missed.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> An officer here or there threw an interrogation. Lycon answered briefly. Democrates
            kept sullen silence. He was clearly present more to prove the good faith of his Medizing
            than for anything he might say. Mardonius smote the ewer again. The soldiers escorted
            the two Hellenes forth. As the curtains closed behind them, the curious saw that the
            features of the beautiful page by the general’s side were contracted with disgust.
            Mardonius himself spat violently. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dogs, and sons of dogs, let Angra-Mainyu wither them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>forever. Bear witness, men of Persia, how, for the sake of our Lord the King, I hold
              converse even with these vilest of the vile!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Soon the council was broken up. The final commands were given. Every officer knew his
            task. The cavalry was to be ready to charge across the Asopus at gray dawn. With Lycon
            and Democrates playing their part the issue was certain, too certain for many a grizzled
            captain who loved the ring of steel. In his own tent Mardonius held in his arms the
            beautiful page—Artazostra! Her wonderful face had never shone up at his more brightly
            than on that night, as he drew back his lips from a long fond kiss. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Noble tidings,”</span> whispered the giant, as the two stood an instant, before each went

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Democrates went his own way also. Soon he was in the fallow-field, where under the
            warm night the Athenians were stretched, each man in armour, his helmet for a pillow. A
            few torches were moving. From a distance came the hum from a group of officers in
            excited conversation. As the orator picked his way among the sleeping men, a locharch
            with a lantern accosted him suddenly. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Morning at last, ruddy and windy. The Persian host had been long prepared. The Tartar
            cavalry with their bulls-hide targets and long lances, the heavy Persian cuirassiers,
            the Median and Assyrian archers with their ponderous wicker-shields, stood in rank
            waiting only the word that should dash them as sling-stones on Pausanias and his
            ill-starred following. The Magi had sacrificed a stallion, and reported that the holy
            fire gave every favouring sign. Mardonius went from his tent, all his eunuchs bowing
            their foreheads to the earth and chorussing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Victory to our Lord, to Persia, and to
              the King.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They brought Mardonius his favourite horse, a white steed of the sacred breed of
            Nisæa. The Prince had bound around his turban the gemmed tiara Xerxes had given him on
            his wedding-day. Few could wield the Babylonish cimeter that danced in the chieftain’s
            hand. The captains cheered him loudly, as they might have cheered the king. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Life to the general! To the satrap of Hellas!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But beside the Nisæan pranced another, lighter and with a lighter mount. The rider was
            cased in silvered scale-armour, and bore only a steel-tipped reed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The general’s page,”</span> ran the whisper, and other whispers, far softer, followed.

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius answered nothing. Long since he had learned the folly of setting his will
            against that of the masterful princess at his side. And was not victory certain? Was not
            Artazostra doing even as Semiramis of Nineveh had done of old? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The army is ready, Excellency,”</span> declared an adjutant, bowing in his saddle. </p>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the gray morning the host wound out of the stockaded camp. The women and grooms
            called fair wishes after them. The far slopes of Cithæron were reddening. A breeze
            whistled down the hills. It would disperse the mist. Soon the leader of the scouts came
            galloping, leaped down and salaamed to the general. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let my Lord’s liver find peace.
              All is even as our friends declared. The enemy have in part fled far away. The
              Athenians halt on a foot-hill of the mountain. The Laconians sit in companies on the
              ground, waiting their division that will not retreat. Let my Lord charge, and glory

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius’s cimeter swung high. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Forward, all! Mazda fights for us. Bid our allies the Thebans<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> attack the Athenians. Ours is the
              nobler prey—even the men of Sparta.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Victory to the king!”</span> thundered the thousands. Confident of triumph, Mardonius
            suffered the ranks to be broken, as his myriads rushed onward. Over the Asopus and its
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shallow fords they swept, and raced across the
            plain-land. Horse mingled with foot; Persians with Tartars. The howlings in a score of
            tongues, the bray of cymbals and kettledrums, the clamour of spear-butts beaten on
            armour—who may tell it? Having unleashed his wild beasts, Mardonius dashed before to
            guide their ragings as he might. The white Nisæan and its companion led the way across
            the hard plain. Behind, as when in the springtime flood the watery wall goes crashing
            down the valley, so spread the thousands. A god looking from heaven would not have
            forgotten that sight of whirling plumes, plunging steeds, flying steel, in all the æons. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Five stadia, six, seven, eight,—so Mardonius led. Already before him he could see the
            glistering crests and long files of the Spartans—the prey he would crush with one
            stroke as a vulture swoops over the sparrow. Then nigh involuntarily his hand drew rein.
            What came to greet him? A man on foot—no horseman even. A man of huge stature running
            at headlong speed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The risen sun was now dazzling. The general clapped his hand above his eyes. Then a
            tug on the bridle sent the Nisæan on his haunches. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lycon, as Mazda made me!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Spartan was beside them soon, he had run so swiftly. He was so dazed he barely
            heeded Mardonius’s call to halt and tell his tale. He was almost naked. His face was
            black with fear, never more brutish or loathsome. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“All is betrayed. Democrates is seized. Pausanias and Aristeides are warned. They will

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who betrayed you?”</span> cried the Prince. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Never before had the son of Gobryas smiled so fiercely as when the giant cowered
            beneath his darting eyes. The general’s sword whistled down on the skull of the traitor.
            The Laconian sprawled in the dust without a groan. Mardonius laughed horribly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A fair price then for unlucky villany. Blessed be Mithra, who suffers me to give
              recompense. Wish me joy,”</span>—as his captains came galloping around him,—<span class="tei tei-q">“our duty
              to the king is finished. We shall win Hellas in fair battle.”</span>
          </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Then it were well, Excellency,”</span> thrust in Artabazus, <span class="tei tei-q">“since the plot is foiled,
              to retire to the camp.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius’s eyes flashed lightnings. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman’s counsel that! Are we not here to conquer Hellas? Yes, by Mithra the Glorious,
              we will fight, though every <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dæva</span></span> in hell joins against us.
              Re-form the ranks. Halt the charge. Let the bowmen crush the Spartans with their
              arrows. Then we will see if these Greeks are stouter than Babylonian, Lydian, and
              Egyptian who played their game with Persia to sore cost. And you, Artabazus, to your
              rear-guard, and do your duty well.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The general bowed stiffly. He knew the son of Gobryas, and that disobedience would
            have brought Mardonius’s cimeter upon his own helmet. By a great effort the charge was
            stayed,—barely in time,—for to have flung that disorganized horde on the waiting
            Spartan spears would have been worse than madness. A single stadium sundered the two
            hosts when Mardonius brought his men to a stand, set his strong divisions of bowmen in
            array behind their wall of shields, and drew up his cavalry on the flanks of the bowmen.
            Battle he would give, but it must be cautious battle now, and he did not love the
            silence which reigned among the motionless lines of the Spartans. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was bright day at last. The two armies—the whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strength of the Barbarian, the Spartans with only their Tegean allies—stood facing,
            as athletes measuring strength before the grapple. The Spartan line was thinner than
            Mardonius’s: no cavalry, few bowmen, but shield was set beside shield, and everywhere
            tossed the black and scarlet plumes of the helmets. Men who remembered Thermopylæ
            gripped their spear-stocks tighter. No long postponing now. On this narrow field, this
            bit of pebble and greensward, the gods would cast the last dice for the destiny of
            Hellas. All knew that. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stolidity of the Spartans was maddening. They stood like bronze statues. In clear
            view at the front was a tall man in scarlet chlamys, and two more in white,—Pausanias
            and his seers examining the entrails of doves, seeking a fair omen for the battle.
            Mardonius drew the turban lower over his eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“An end to this truce. Begin your arrows.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A cloud of bolts answered him. The Persian archers emptied their quivers. They could
            see men falling among the foe, but still Pausanias stood beside the seers, still he gave
            no signal to advance. The omens doubtless were unfavourable. His men never shifted a
            foot as the storm of death flew over them. Their rigidity was more terrifying than any
            battle-shout. What were these men whose iron discipline bound so fast that they could be
            pelted to death, and no eyelash seem to quiver? The archers renewed their volley. They
            shot against a rock. The Barbarians joined in one rending yell,—their answer was
            silence. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Deliberately, arrows dropping around him as tree-blossoms in the gale, Pausanias
            raised his hand. The omens were good. The gods permitted battle. Deliberately, while men
            fell dying, he walked to his post on the right wing. Deliberately, while heaven seemed
            shaking with the Barbarians’ <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>clamour, his hand went up
            again. Through a lull in the tumult pealed a trumpet. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Then the
              Spartans marched.</span></span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Slowly their lines of bristling spear-points and nodding crests moved on like the
            sea-waves. Shrill above the booming Tartar drums, the blaring Persian war-horns pierced
            the screams of their pipers. And the Barbarians heard that which had never met their
            ears before,—the chanting of their foes as the long line crept nearer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!—la—la—la—la! Ah!—la—la—la—la!”</span> deep, prolonged, bellowed in chorus
            from every bronze visor which peered above the serried shields. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Faster,”</span> stormed the Persian captains to their slingers and bowmen, <span class="tei tei-q">“beat these
              madmen down.”</span> The rain of arrows and sling-stones was like hail, like hail it
            rattled from the shields and helms. Here, there, a form sank, the inexorable phalanx
            closed and swept onward. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!—la—la—la! Ah!—la—la—la!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chant never ceased. The pipers screamed more shrilly. Eight deep, unhasting,
            unresting, Pausanias was bringing his heavy infantry across the two hundred paces
            betwixt himself and Mardonius. His Spartan spearmen might be unlearned, doltish, but
            they knew how to do one deed and that surpassingly well,—to march in line though
            lightnings dashed from heaven, and to thrust home with their lances. And not a pitiful
            three hundred, but ten thousand bold and strong stood against the Barbarian that
            morning. Mardonius was facing the finest infantry in the world, and the avenging of
            Leonidas was nigh. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!—la—la—la! Ah!—la—la—la!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Flesh and blood in the Persian host could not wait the death grip longer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us
              charge, or let us flee,”</span> many a stout officer cried to his chief, and he sitting
            stern-eyed on the white horse gave to a Tartar troop its word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go!”</span>
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span>
          <a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then like a mountain stream the wild Tartars charged. The clods flew high under the
            hoofs. The yell of the riders, the shock of spears on shields, the cry of dying men and
            dying beasts, the stamping, the dust-cloud, took but a moment. The chant of the Spartans
            ceased—an instant. An instant the long phalanx halted, from end to end bent and swayed.
            Then the dust-cloud passed, the chanting renewed. Half of the Tartars were spurring
            back, with shivered lances, bleeding steeds. The rest,—but the phalanx shook now here,
            now there, as the impenetrable infantry strode over red forms that had been men and
            horses. And still the Spartans marched, still the pipes and the war-chant. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then for the first time fear entered the heart of Mardonius, son of Gobryas, and he
            called to the thousand picked horsemen, who rode beside him,—not Tartars these, but
            Persians and Medes of lordly stock, men who had gone forth conquering and to conquer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Now as your fathers followed Cyrus the Invincible and Darius the Dauntless, follow
              you me. Since for the honour of Eran and the king I ride this day.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We ride. For Eran and the king!”</span> shouted the thousand. All the host joined.
            Mardonius led straight against the Spartan right wing where Pausanias’s life-guard
            marched. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Old soldiers of Lacedæmon fighting their battles in the after days, when a warrior of
            Platæa was as a god to each youth in Hellas, would tell how the Persian cavalrymen rode
            their phalanx down. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And say never,”</span> they always added, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Barbarians know not how to fight and how
              to die. Fools say it, not we of Platæa. For our first line seemed broken in a
              twinkling. The <a name="corr432" id="corr432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Pitanate</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mora</span></span>

              charge when Mardonius led the way.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But turned it was. And the thousand horse, no thousand now, drifted to the cover of
            their shield wall, raging, undaunted, yet beaten back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then at last the phalanx locked with the Persian footmen and their rampart of wicker
            shields. At short spear length men grinned in each other’s faces, while their veins were
            turned to fire. Many a soldier—Spartan, Aryan—had seen his twenty fights, but never a
            fight like this. And the Persians—those that knew Greek—heard words flung through
            their foemen’s helmets that made each Hellene fight as ten. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember Leonidas! Remember Thermopylæ!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Orders there were none; the trumpets were drowned in the tumult. Each man fought as he
            stood, knowing only he must slay the man before him, while slowly, as though by a cord
            tighter and ever tighter drawn, the Persian shield wall was bending back before the
            unrelenting thrusting of the Spartans. Then as a cord snaps so broke the barrier. One
            instant down and the Hellenes were sweeping the light-armed Asiatic footmen before them,
            as the scythe sweeps down the standing grain. So with the Persian infantry, for their
            scanty armour and short spears were at terrible disadvantage, but the strength of the
            Barbarian was not spent. Many times Mardonius led the cavalry in headlong charge, each
            repulse the prelude to a fiercer shock. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The call of the Prince was a call that turned his wild horsemen into demons, but
            demons who strove with gods. The phalanx was shaken, halted even, broken never; and foot
            by foot, fathom by fathom, it brushed the Barbarian horde back across the blood-bathed
            plain,—and to Mardonius’s shout, a more terrible always answered:— </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span>
          <a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince seemed to bear a charmed life as he fought. He was in the thickest fray. He
            sent the white Nisæan against the Laconian spears and beat down a dozen lance-points
            with his sword. If one man’s valour could have turned the tide, his would have wrought
            the miracle. And always behind, almost in reach of the Grecian sling-stones, rode that
            other,—the page in the silvered mail,—nor did any harm come to this rider. But after
            the fight had raged so long that men sank unwounded,—gasping, stricken by the heat and
            press,—the Prince drew back a little from the fray to a rising in the plain, where
            close by a rural temple of Demeter he could watch the drifting fight, and he saw the
            Aryans yielding ground finger by finger, yet yielding, and the phalanx impregnable as
            ever. Then he sent an aide with an urgent message. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To Artabazus and the reserve. Bid him take from the camp all the guards, every man,
              every eunuch that can lift a spear, and come with speed, or the day is lost.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The adjutant’s spurs grew red as he pricked away, while Mardonius wheeled the Nisæan
            and plunged back into the thickest fight. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His battle-call pealed even above the hellish din. The Persian nobles who had never
            ridden to aught save victory turned again. Their last charge was their fiercest. They
            bent the phalanx back like an inverted bow. Their footmen, reckless of self, plunged on
            the Greeks and snapped off the spear-points with their naked hands. Mardonius was never
            prouder of his host than in that hour. Proud—but the charge was vain. As the tide swept
            back, as the files of the Spartans locked once more, he knew his men had done their
            uttermost. They had fought since dawn. Their shield wall was broken. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Their quivers were empty. Was not Mazda turning against them?
            Had not enough been dared for that king who lounged at ease in Sardis? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Mardonius’s shout had no answer. Here, there, he saw horsemen and footmen, now singly,
            now in small companies, drifting backward across the plain to the last refuge of the
            defeated, the stockaded camp by the Asopus. The Prince called on his cavalry, so few
            about him now. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall we die as scared dogs? Remember the Aryan glory. Another charge!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His bravest seemed never to hear him. The onward thrust of the phalanx quickened. It
            was gaining ground swiftly at last. Then the Spartans were dashing forward like men
            possessed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Athenians have vanquished the Thebans. They come to join us. On, men of
              Lacedæmon, ours alone must be this victory!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The shout of Pausanias was echoed by his captains. To the left and not far off charged
            a second phalanx,—five thousand nodding crests and gleaming points,—Aristeides
            bringing his whole array to his allies’ succour. But his help was not needed. The sight
            of his coming dashed out the last courage of the Barbarians. Before the redoubled shock
            of the Spartans the Asiatics crumbled like sand. Even whilst these broke once more, the
            adjutant drew rein beside Mardonius. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, Artabazus is coward or traitor. Believing the battle lost, he has fled. There
              is no help to bring.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Prince bowed his head an instant, while the flight surged round him. The Nisæan
            was covered with blood, but his rider spurred him across the path of a squadron of
            flying Medians. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span>
          <a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Turn! Are you grown women!”</span> Mardonius smote the nearest with his sword. <span class="tei tei-q">“If we
              cannot as Aryans conquer, let us at least as Aryans die!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ai! ai!</span></span> Mithra deserts us. Artabazus is fled. Save who

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They swept past him. He flung himself before a band of Tartars. He had better pleaded
            with the north wind to stay its course. Horse, foot, Babylonians, Ethiopians, Persians,
            Medes, were huddled in fleeing rout. <span class="tei tei-q">“To the camp,”</span> their cry, but Mardonius,
            looking on the onrushing phalanxes knew there was no refuge there.... </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now sing it, O mountains and rivers of Hellas. Sing it, Asopus, to Spartan
            Eurotas, and you to hill-girt Alphæus. And let the maidens, white-robed and
            poppy-crowned, sweep in thanksgiving up to the welcoming temples,—honouring Zeus of the
            Thunders, Poseidon the Earth-Shaker, Athena the Mighty in War. The Barbarian is
            vanquished. The ordeal is ended. Thermopylæ was not in vain, nor Salamis. Hellas is
            saved, and with her saved the world. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again on the knoll by the temple, apart from the rushing fugitives, Mardonius reined.
            His companion was once more beside him. He leaned that she might hear him through the
            tumult. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The battle is lost. The camp is defenceless. What shall we do?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Artazostra flung back the gold-laced cap and let the sun play over her face and hair. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We are Aryans,”</span> was all her answer. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He understood, but even whilst he was reaching out to catch her bridle that their
            horses might run together, he saw her lithe form bend. The arrow from a Laconian helot
            had smitten through the silvered mail. He saw the red <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spring out over her breast. With a quick grasp he swung her before him on the white
            horse. She smiled up in his face, never lovelier. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Glaucon was right,”</span> she said,—their lips were very close,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus and Athena are
              greater than Mazda and Mithra. The future belongs to Hellas. But we have naught for
              shame. We have fought as Aryans, as the children of conquerors and kings. We shall be
              glad together in Garonmana the Blessed, and what is left to dread?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A quiver passed through her. The Spartan spear-line was close. Mardonius looked once
            across the field. His men were fleeing like sheep. And so it passed,—the dream of a
            satrapy of Hellas, of wider conquests, of an empire of the world. He kissed the face of
            Artazostra and pressed her still form against his breast. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”</span> he shouted, and threw away his sword. Then he
            turned the head of his wounded steed and rode on the Spartan lances. </p>

            was still, though the messenger told how Pausanias and his allies had taken countless
            treasure, and now were making ready to attack disloyal Thebes. So the admiral and his
            escort went at leisure across Bœotia, till they reached the Hellenic host still camped
            near the battle-field. There Themistocles was long in conference with Aristeides and
            Pausanias. After midnight he left Aristeides’s tent. </p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“I will guide you.”</span> The soldier took a torch and led the way. The two went down
            dark avenues of tents, and halted at one where five hoplites stood guard with their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles set down the casket and carefully drew the tent-flap. With silent tread
            he approached the slumberer. The face was upturned; white it was, but it showed the same
            winsome features that had won the clappings a hundred times in the Pnyx. The sleep
            seemed heavy, dreamless. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Themistocles’s own lips tightened as he stood in contemplation, then he bent to touch

            Hellenes’ victories. At Mycale by Samos the Greek fleets had disembarked their crews and
            defeated the Persians almost at the doors of the Great King in Sardis. Artabazus had
            escaped through Thrace to Asia in caitiff flight. The war—at least the perilous part
            thereof—was at end. There might be more battles with the Barbarian, but no second
            Salamis or Platæa. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Spartans had found the body of Mardonius pierced with five lances—all in front.
            Pausanias had honoured the brave dead,—the Persian had been carried from the
            battle-ground on a shield, and covered by the red cloak of a Laconian general. But the
            body mysteriously disappeared. Its fate was never known. Perhaps the curious would have
            gladly heard what Glaucon on his sick-bed told Themistocles, and what Sicinnus did
            afterward. Certain it is that the shrewd Asiatic later displayed a costly ring which the

            return to Athens. When they had told Hermione all that had befallen,—the great good,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the little ill,—she had not fainted, though Cleopis
            had been sure thereof. The colour had risen to her cheeks, the love-light to her eyes.

            black ruins, for Mardonius had wasted everything before retiring to Bœotia for his last
            battle. In Athens, as they entered it, the houses were roofless, the streets scattered
            with rubbish. But Hermione did not think of these things. The Agora at last,—the
            porticos were only shattered, fire-scarred pillars,—and everywhere were tents and
            booths and bustle,—the brisk Athenians wasting no time in lamentation, but busy
            rebuilding and making good the loss. Above Hermione’s head rose a few blackened
            columns,—all that was left of the holy house of Athena,—but the crystalline air and
            the red Rock of the Acropolis no Persian had been able to take away. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And even as Hermione crossed the Agora she heard a shouting, a word running from lip
            to lip as a wave leaps over the sea. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the centre of the buzzing mart she stopped. All the blood sprang to her face, then
            left it. She passed her fingers over her hair, and waited with twitching, upturned face.
            Through the hucksters’ booths, amid the clamouring buyers and sellers, went a runner,
            striking left and right with his staff, for the people were packing close, and he had
            much ado to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>clear the way. Horsemen next, prancing
            chargers, the prizes from the Barbarian, and after them a litter. Noble youths bore it,
            sons of the Eupatrid houses of Athens. At sight of the litter the buzz of the Agora
            became a roar. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The beautiful! The fortunate! The deliverer! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Io! Io, pæan!</span></span>”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hermione stood; only her eyes followed the litter. Its curtains were flung back; she
            saw some one within, lying on purple cushions. She saw the features, beautiful as
            Pentelic marble and as pale. She cared not for the people. She cared not that Phœnix,
            frighted by the shouting, had begun to wail. The statue in the litter moved, rose on one
            elbow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, dearest and best,”</span>—his voice had the old-time ring, his head the old-time

            found the Acropolis peculiarly worthy of his study. Enough that Hermione’s hands were

            Trœzene. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The young men were just taking up the litter, when the Agora again broke into cheers.
            Themistocles, saviour of Hellas, had crossed to Glaucon. The admiral—never more
            worshipped than now, when every plan he wove seemed perfect as a god’s—took Glaucon and
            Hermione, one by each hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philotatoi</span></span>,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“to all of us is given by the
              sisters above so much bliss and so much sorrow. Some drink the bitter first, some the
              sweet. And you have drained the bitter to the lees. Therefore look up at the Sun-King
              boldly. He will not darken for you again.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Where now?”</span> asked Hermione, in all things looking to her husband. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“To the Acropolis,”</span> ordered Glaucon. <span class="tei tei-q">“If the temple is desolate, the Rock is
              still holy. Let us give thanks to Athena.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He even would have left the litter, had not Themistocles firmly forbidden. In time the
            Alcmæonid’s strength would return, though never the speed that had left the stadia
            behind whilst he raced to save Hellas. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They mounted the Rock. From above, in the old-time brightness, the noonday light, the
            sunlight of Athens, sprang down to them. Hermione, looking on Glaucon’s face, saw him
            gaze eagerly upon her, his child, the sacred Rock, and the glory from Helios. Then his
            face wore a strange smile <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>she could not understand. She
            did not know that he was saying in his heart:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And I thought for the rose vales of Bactria to forfeit—this!”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They were on the summit. The litter was set down on the projecting spur by the
            southwest corner. The area of the Acropolis was desolation, ashes, drums of overturned
            pillars, a few lone and scarred columns. The works of man were in ruin, but the works of
            the god, of yesterday, to-day, and forever were yet the same. They turned their backs on
            the ruin. Westward they looked—across land and sea, beautiful always, most beautiful
            now, for had they not been redeemed with blood and tears? The Barbarian was vanquished;
            the impossible accomplished. Hellas and Athens were their own, with none to take away. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They saw the blue bay of Phaleron. They saw the craggy height of Munychia, Salamis
            with its strait of the victory, farther yet the brown dome of Acro-Corinthus and the
            wide breast of the clear Saronian sea. To the left was Hymettus the Shaggy, to right the
            long crest of Daphni, behind them rose Pentelicus, home of the marble that should take
            the shape of the gods. With one voice they fell to praising Athens and Hellas, wisely or
            foolishly, according to their wit. Only Hermione and Glaucon kept silence, hand within
            hand, and speaking fast,—not with their lips,—but with their eyes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then at the end Themistocles spoke, and as always spoke the best. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We have flung back the Barbarian. We have set our might against the God-King and have

              hard. The making of Athens immortal by the beauty of our lives, and words, and deeds
              is harder. Yet in this also we shall conquer. Yea, verily, for the day shall come that
              wherever the eye is charmed by the beautiful, the heart is thrilled by the noble, or
              the soul yearns after the perfect,—there in the spirit shall stand Athens.”</span>

            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
